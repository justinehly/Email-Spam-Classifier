    "- The objective of this project is to build an email spam classifier using Naive Bayes and clustering methods.\n",
    "- Since there is no inherent structured dataset we will rely on raw email messages from 5 separate folders that are pre-classified as either spam or ham (not spam). \n",
    "- From an educational standpoint, this type of work/ exercise is important because often in data science we will experience unstructured data that needs to be structured, mined for meaning and ultimately in this case provide a benefit to end users by classifying emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "- From a business standpoint, it's important to gain insight on the types of spam the company might recieve and what may differentiate that from real emails. Spam filters are important because they allow employees to not loose their important emails in a sea of spam in their inbox, or conversely loose their important emails to the spam folder. \n",

    "- Which methods are you proposing to utilize to solve the problem?  \n",
    "    - We will use several methods for this problem since the data set is unstructured. \n",
    "    - One approach will be to use the provided classifications to build a more traditional structured dataframe, building features as we go. We can use this for exploratory analysis, and to build a simple Kmeans classifier for clustering. Theorectically we could use this with other structured classification methods, however that is outside the scope of this project.\n",
    "    - We will also form a more complex KMeans model using the raw text from the emails that has been cleaned and run through TF-IDF. This will attempt to cluster the data on the sparse dataset of words. \n",
    "    - We will also use a Naive Bayes classifier to determine if an email is spam or ham. For comparison we will do one with the results of the complex KMeans model and one without.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why is this method appropriate given the business objective? \n",
    "    - Unsupervised learning via clustering is frequently used with text data due to the unstructured nature of the data. The clusters are a way to make sense of the massive amounts of data by forming groups that share similarities that may not be immediately apparent to the human eye.\n",
    "    - Naive Bayes classifiers work well with text classification and as a spam filter. The algorithm is fast due to its lack of complication compared to logistic regression, but logistic regression will tend to get better performance scores due to its more complicated algorithm. For email classification, we tend to lean more towards quick deployment so the classifier can work in real-time and be updated on a regular basis. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- How will you determine if your approach is useful (or how will you differentiate which approach is more useful than another)? \n",
    "    - Since it is unstructured data, we can gleen some insight just from visually comparing clusters. \n",
    "    - An approach that can be implemented with less computational time and complexity that has the highest sucess rate at filtering out spam without filtering out too many important emails will be the most useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- More specifically, what evaluation metrics are most useful given that the problem is a classification one (ex., F1-score, Accuracy, AUC, etc.)?\n",
    "    - For KMeans, we will specifically look at the inertia and homogeneity to choose the appropriate number of clusters (primarily using the Elbow Method). To evaluate our final model, we will visually assess the model and use \n",
    "    - For Naive Bayes, we will use accuracy, precision and recall, with the intent to maximize accuracy, since getting the most correct is the most important thing. (Classifying incorrectly either way will have the same functional effect on employee productivity)."

    "    - We can see that the vast majority of emails are NOT replies.    \n",
    "    - Very few spam emails are also replies, which makes sense because spammers are typically the first to make contact. The spam emails that are replies might have been from employees accidentally responding to the original spam message, and the spammer replying back.    \n",
    "       \n",
    "<b>Caps Lock:</b>   \n",
    "    - Although the total number of emails where the subject line is in all caps are small, it's very telling when they do occur. Hardly any legitamate emails use all caps.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "<b>Attachments:</b>      \n",
    "    - While total number of attachments recieved from spam and ham emails is similar, the ratio of spammers sending attachments appears to be much higher.   "

This scale is meant to show the relative reading difficulty of a passage of text, with a lower number being much harder to read than a higher number (0 = graduate school, 100 = 5th grader could read). \n",
    "The scale was developed for use in academia and does not appear to tranfer well to casual english emails, considering the presence of large negative numbers which are essentially uninterpretable. It's unclear whether this could be inproved by running it following the text clean-up process, but we will just drop it from the analysis.  "

Staring into\\nhis empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator\\'s mind landed on an\\nunlikely solution: Put a tax--just a \"benign\" dime a shot--on\\nespresso.\\n\\nThat led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,\\nand next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one\\nthat taps right into Seattle\\'s legendary addiction to coffee. This is,\\nafter all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound\\nof beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000\\nresidents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle\\nalso has two other major coffee chains, Tully\\'s Coffee and Seattle\\'s\\nBest Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.\\n\\nA recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the\\ntax. \"For people outside of Seattle who don\\'t understand the\\nconsumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,\"\\nsaid John Burbank, the think tank\\'s executive director, \"but it was\\ncommon sense.\"\\n\\nResearch by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that\\npeople preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But\\nbecause of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on\\nespresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.\\n\\nBurbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a\\nyear. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research\\nshows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.\\n\\nBurbank\\'s institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The\\nthink tank\\'s mission is to promote public policy in the interests of\\nlow-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.\\n\\nBurbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs\\nmade earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would\\nprovide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,\\nimprove preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.\\n\\nAt Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of\\ncustomers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.\\n\\nEspresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an\\nextra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. \"I\\'m OK with\\nit,\" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. \"The money\\'s got\\nto come from somewhere.\"\\n\\nHope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she\\nbrought her own mug) and reading \"Zen and the Art of Pottery.\" She\\nsupports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be\\nexpected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on\\nthe menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.\\n\\nSome say the tax isn\\'t the issue; they just resent being singled out.\\n\\nDavid Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a\\nday, which means he\\'d be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. \"I, for\\none, don\\'t have kids, but I drink espresso,\" he said, as he sewed a\\nleather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. \"I don\\'t mind paying, but I\\nthink everyone should pay.\"\\n\\nCoffeehouses are steamed about it, and they\\'ve organized as\\nJOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle\\'s\\nChamber of Commerce and the city\\'s two largest coffee franchises,\\nStarbucks and Tully\\'s.\\n\\nThe tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that\\ncontains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare\\nfor smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If\\nespresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a\\ncity audit.\\n\\nUniversity of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn\\'t add up. \\n\\n\"The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is\\nneither,\" he said. \"On the efficiency side, it\\'s surely going to lead\\nto costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to\\navoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using\\nfinely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]\\nand that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be\\nright? I don\\'t know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal\\nfees that could have gone to child care.\\n\\n\"Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious\\nidea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They\\'ve pitted espresso\\ndrinkers against child-care supporters, and who\\'s going to side with\\nthe espresso drinkers?\"\\n\\nIn fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political\\ntwo-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public\\nstance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,\\ncorporations continually advertise their commitment to social\\nactivism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members\\nprefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.\\n\\n\"Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and\\nchildhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we\\ncontribute annually,\" the company said. \"However, Starbucks does not\\nunderstand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an\\nadditional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single\\nconsumer product.\"\\n\\nThe City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before\\nvoters next year. The initiative\\'s authors say it is directed at\\nvendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through\\nhigher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.\\nThe tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of\\nespresso, including decaf.

A proposed law based on the discussion \\ndraft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in \\nearly 2003.\\n\\nArguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, \\nCanadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and \\ncombat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting \\nthese proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the \\nCouncil of Europe\\'s cybercrime treaty \\n<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the \\nprocess of considering.\\n\\nIf the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the \\npossession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet \\nproviders to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and \\npermit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find \"hidden \\nelectronic and digital devices\" that a suspect might be concealing. In \\nmost circumstances, a court order would be required for government \\nagents to conduct Internet monitoring.\\n\\nCanada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of \\nEurope, and representatives from both countries\\' police agencies have \\nendorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty \\n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has \\ndrawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. \\nOf nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted \\n<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, \\nor ratified, the treaty.\\n\\nMichael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the \\nUniversity of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the \\njustification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems \\nweak.\\n\\n\"It seems to me that the main justification they\\'ve given for all the \\nchanges is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to \\nmake changes,\" Geist said. \"To me that\\'s not a particularly convincing \\nargument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, \\nmake that case.\"\\n\\nGeist added that \"there\\'s nothing in the document that indicates (new \\npowers) are needed. I don\\'t know that there have been a significant \\nnumber of cases where police have run into problems.\"\\n\\nProbably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is \\ncompelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure \\ntheir networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention \\norders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the \\nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act \\n<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it \\napplies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.\\n\\n\"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and \\nInternet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical \\ncapability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national \\nsecurity agencies,\" according to the proposal. Companies would be \\nresponsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.\\n\\nSarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center \\n<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says \\nthe proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. \"Their \\nproposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not \\njust Internet providers,\" Andrews said. \"The cybercrime treaty deals \\nonly with computer data.\" EPIC opposes \\n<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> \\nthe cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and \\ndoes not adequately respect privacy rights.\\n\\nAnother section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs \\nof Police recommends \"the establishment of a national database\" with \\npersonal information about all Canadian Internet users. \"The \\nimplementation of such a database would presuppose that service \\nproviders are compelled to provide accurate and current information,\" \\nthe draft says.\\n\\nGus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an \\nactivist with Privacy International, calls the database \"a dumb idea.\"\\n\\n\"Immediately you have to wonder if you\\'re allowed to use anonymous \\nmobile phones or whether you\\'re allowed to connect to the Internet \\nanonymously,\" Hosein said.\\n\\nA representative for George Radwanski \\n<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada\\'s privacy commissioner, said \\nthe office is reviewing the blueprint and does not \"have any comments on \\nthe paper as it stands.\"\\n\\nComments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca \\n<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

For a better design for similar ideas, see\\nthe MacOS.\\n\\n-- \\nI'm not a pheasant plucker / I'm a pheasant plucker's son.\\nI'm just a'plucking pheasants / 'Til the pheasant plucker comes.\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Introduced by Sen. Ron\\nWyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act\\nwould create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is\\nco-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).\\n\\nThe proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would\\nsupport long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective\\neducation and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers\\nand professionals.\\n\\n\"The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step\\nforward for this very small technology,\" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to\\nfull Senate passage before the end of the year, said. \"Nowhere in the world\\nare the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of\\nnanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to\\nlead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide\\nthe nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate\\nnew collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will\\nensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation.\"\\n\\nThe bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology\\nprogram under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also\\ncreate a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National\\nNanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and\\ntechnical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.\\n\\n\"My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to\\nchange America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer\\nrevolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will\\nmine the opportunities of nanotechnology,\" Wyden said in introducing the\\nbill. \"At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a\\nhalf-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various\\nnanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world\\'s leader\\nin this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to\\nachieving that goal.\\n\\nTo study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for\\nSocietal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to\\nNanotechnology would also be established.\\n\\nAccording to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the\\nNational Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the\\nNational Nanotechnology Initiative in June.\\n\\nThose recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;\\nemphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and\\nshort-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,\\nequipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research\\nthat falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting\\ninterdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology\\ntransition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal\\nimplications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,\\neducational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for\\nmeasuring progress toward program goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Then put this on\\na new line in \\n\\n/etc/modules\\n\\nin order that linux will load it on boot.  You can just do\\n\\nmodprobe nvdriver\\n\\nto load it by hand.

As\\ndebian has lots of potential kernels they can't have one nvdriver package\\nand have chosen instead to provide the source.

You\\'re supposed to just shut up and take it.\"\\n\\nhttp://winerlog.inspiredsites.net/\\n\\n===========\\n\\nWho\\'s the real monster?\\n\\n\\nIt seems good Ol\\' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that\\ndares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too\\nstrong a case.  So here we Dave\\'s attempt to fool you into thinking they\\'re\\nsome sort of monsters, violent ones no less.\\n\\nAnyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people\\nare nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their\\nway.\\n\\nYeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.\\n\\nThe truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and\\nimproving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be\\nsure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move\\nforward.  How is that being monstrous?\\n\\nIs Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public\\'s\\nperception of them?  If you haven\\'t already, contact them and ask them how\\nthey feel about this foolishness.\\n\\n\\n 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\nDave deflects what he can\\'t take the time to understand\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s really quite pitiful.  When normal people don\\'t understand something\\nthey usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek\\nthe help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off\\nand looking like fools.\\n\\nWhat Dave does is just the opposite.\\n\\nPosts a link to something he doesn\\'t understand\\nGet\\'s a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it\\nDerides the idea as being \\'too much trouble\\' and blogs it.\\nExpects others to do research for him\\nAbuses anyone who tries to help him\\nPontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue\\nRealizes he\\'s been a fool but refuses to correct himself\\nPlods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy\\nTries making the educated people look like fools.\\nSends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.\\nExposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.\\nDeflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1\\nHis continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it\\'s use of RDF reveal this to be\\ntrue.  Dave doesn\\'t get the idea of the semantic web.  He\\'d rather have you\\nfollow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth\\ntrying.\\n\\nOne reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  \"It\\'s like that movie The\\nPoseidon Adventure.  Dave\\'s like the purser ranting and raving that the\\npassengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don\\'t know about\\nyou but I\\'d rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.\\nThe ship\\'s fucking sinking and I don\\'t want to be following the idiot.\"\\n\\nDave\\'s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach\\naround.  You\\'re supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would\\ngood ol\\' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It\\'s all about love, right?  To hell\\nwith asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he\\nsavages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you\\'re the one causing\\nall the trouble.\\n\\nWe\\'ve news for you Dave, we\\'re wise to your tactics and we\\'re talking\\namongst ourselves about it.  We\\'re routing around you damaging behavoir.\\nThat\\'s where we\\'re coming from.\\n\\nIf you have an example of how you\\'ve tried to help Dave, please drop us an\\ne-mail about it.  We\\'ll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it\\nalong to zaphod@egroups.com\\n\\n\\n 9/12/02; 10:13:11 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...\\n\\n\\nThe trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.\\n\\nAnother developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it\\'s fundamentally\\nimpossible:\\n\\nHis basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web\\ndevelopers are doing a terrible job.\\n\\nIn the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that\\npeople at other tables start whispering \"that guy is an idiot...\"\\n\\nThe zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you\\'ve got a similar\\ntale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 2:17:58 PM - Discuss (1 response)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAha! Some backing down by the whining one?\\n\\n\\nIt would appear the \\'dictator release\\' strategy that Dave\\'s been trying on\\nhis crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.\\n\\nI\\'m going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.\\nStill have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for\\ntime-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have\\nto prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A\\nbusy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people\\nwho make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any\\ndeal-stoppers.\\n\\nHell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use\\nit!\\n\\nThe poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They\\'re going to be\\ndragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So\\nwith the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their\\ncontent into totally unsupported garbage!!!\\n\\nYa better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start\\ngetting rejected!\\n\\nOf course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter\\nfucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his\\n\\'blame America\\' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed\\nwith his dictator release of RSS.  Now he\\'s trying to pretend we should be\\nnice to him because he\\'s still recovering?\\n\\nUh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking\\nfights.  We\\'ll still kick your ass regardless.  That\\'s what years of your\\nabusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 1:56:10 PM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDave is Scary on 9/11\\n\\nPosted on Scripting News on 9/10/2002:\\n\\n\\nNote: During the day tomorrow there will be no updates to Scripting News.\\nI\\'ll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for\\nPublishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of\\nUserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there\\'s\\nsomething really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe\\n9-11.\\nWhat kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously\\nsomeone who doesn\\'t have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.\\n\\n\\n 9/11/02; 7:56:06 AM - Discuss\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYeow and we though we were harsh!\\n\\n\\nWow, apparently Dave\\'s sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig\\nSchamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.

It\\nwould seem to be a conflation of the British expression \"arse over\\nteakettle\" and the American \"ass over appetite\" (note my deliberate\\nuse of the two spellings of \"arse\" here!). The saying was probably\\nmodified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an\\nitem less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these\\ndays it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression,\\nwhich itself is now not very common.\\n\\nBUMBERSHOOT  Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is\\nin the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film \"Chitty\\nChitty Bang Bang\":\\n\\n  Me ol\\' bam-boo, me ol\\' bam-boo\\n  You\\'d better never bother with me ol\\' bam-boo\\n  You can have me hat or me bumbershoot\\n  But you\\'d better never bother with me ol\\' bam-boo\\n\\nIt may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word\\nin their own country, have come to believe it must be British.\\n\\nOLOGIES AND ISMS  The publication date of my book has been moved\\nback a week in the UK to 29 August. A review by Jonathon Green is\\nscheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the\\ndate again). See <http://www.worldwidewords.org/ologies.htm> for\\nmore details and UK ordering information.\\n\\n\\n2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAs though we didn\\'t have enough to worry about weather-wise, what\\nwith global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El Niño season,\\nUN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world\\'s\\nclimate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping\\nthe whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants,\\ncarbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from\\nburning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15%\\nof sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain,\\nleads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme\\nweather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed\\nrapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just\\nAsia. The term \"Asian Brown Cloud\" seems to have been around for a\\ncouple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this\\nweek in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists\\nat the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit\\non Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good\\nnews, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and\\nclimate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more\\nefficient ways of burning fuels.\\n\\nThe \"Asian Brown Cloud,\" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over\\nSouth Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million\\npeople in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and\\ndrought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates.\\n                                   [\"Los Angeles Times\", Aug. 2002]\\n\\nA UN-backed study released on Friday said the \"Asian Brown Cloud\" -\\na vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging\\nagriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the\\npopulation.\\n                                [\"Agence France Presse\", Aug. 2002]\\n\\n\\n3. Weird Words: Pyknic  /\\'pIknIk/\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nShort and fat.\\n\\nNothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way\\nas \"picnic\".\\n\\nIn the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist\\nErnst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical\\nshape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses.\\nTall and thin ones he called \"asthenic\" (or \"leptosomic\") and\\nconsidered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft.\\nA second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom\\nhe concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The\\nthird sort were the \"pyknic\" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of\\nthe other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were\\nconcerned. He took \"pyknic\" from Greek \"puknos\", thick or close-\\npacked; it appeared first in his book \"Körperbau und Charakter\"\\n(Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into\\nEnglish.\\n\\nThe American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified\\nKretschmer\\'s ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body\\ntypes - \"endomorph\", \"mesomorph\" and \"ectomorph\" - that are now\\nmore common. He considered Kretschmer\\'s pyknic type to be a mixture\\nof the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the\\nSanta Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and\\nathletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came\\nup with the phrase \"pyknic practical joke\" to describe a person who\\nis muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and\\nballoons out into obesity.\\n\\n\\n4. Q&A\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\nQ. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the \"New York\\nTimes\" that made mention of a \"mash note\". I had never heard this\\nterm before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note.\\nIs there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can\\nyou give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane\\nRosenthal, California]\\n\\nA. You\\'re right about the meaning of the phrase.\\n\\nWe have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was\\nthe word \"mash\" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the\\n1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as\\n\"a deep but fleeting affection of the heart\"). A \"mash\" could also\\nbe a dandy or the object of one\\'s affection (of either sex) or - as\\na verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex,\\nto flirt or seduce. A \"masher\" was a man who thought himself\\nirresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often\\nunwelcome.\\n\\nThe evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the \"Random House\\nHistorical Dictionary of American Slang\" and by others suggests\\nthat it was originally a term used in and around the theatre.\\nCharles Godfrey Leland (best known for his \"Hans Breitmann\\x92s\\nBallads\" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem,\\n\"The Masher\", dated about 1895, confirming this:\\n\\n  The word to \"mash,\" in the sense of causing love or\\n  attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into\\n  ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress\\n  was often fined for \"mashing\" or smiling at men in the\\n  audience.\\n\\n\"Mash\" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about\\n1880. \"Masher\" in particular became a term in London society,\\nespecially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going\\nclasses, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English\\nDictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing\\naway its collective skirts) as \"a fop of affected manners and\\nexaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and\\nfashionable promenades and who posed as a \\'lady-killer\\'\", noting\\nthat the word had been common \"in 1882 and for a few years after\".\\nIn a letter from London in the old \"Overland Monthly and Out West\\nMagazine\" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an\\nimpoverished theatrical company: \"This dashing youth was distinctly\\nconscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside\\nus, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that\\nsuperbly took them in would be a lesson for champion \\'mashers\\' of a\\nfar higher class\".\\n\\nA \"mash note\" (in its first appearances, \"mash letter\") was an\\nobvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in\\n1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well.\\n\\nWhere \"mash\" and its relatives come from has been a subject of\\ndebate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English\\nword meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious\\nreference to rendering the object of one\\'s attentions pliable and\\nyielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were\\nstill around then, despite the OED\\'s comment) remarked that some\\npeople derived it from \"Ma Chère\", \"the mode of address used by the\\ngilded youth to the barmaids of the period\". But he thought it\\nreally came from \"the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a\\ngreat vogue in the music-halls: \\'I\\'m the slashing, dashing, mashing\\nMontmorency of the day.\\'\" We\\'re pretty sure now that he was wrong,\\nbut he could hardly know that.\\n\\nBack to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he\\nalso researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as\\nwell as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the\\nintroduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely\\naccepted:\\n\\n  It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors,\\n  C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word\\n  \"masher\" or \"mash\" means in that tongue to allure, delude,\\n  or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by\\n  its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be\\n  no doubt as to the gypsy origin of \"mash\" as used on the\\n  stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well-\\n  known impresario Palmer of New York, and I made a note of\\n  it years before the term had become at all popular.\\n\\nThough defunct in British English, \"mash\" and \"masher\" have never\\nquite gone away in America. \"Mash\" had a resurgence of popularity\\nas student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting,\\nthough that may be a back-formation from \"mash note\".\\n\\n\\n5.

In 1947, \\nthe Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge \\nthe racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders \\nwere jailed often ending up on chain gangs.\\n\\nBy 1961, the time was right to challenge America\\'s Jim Crow \\nlaws and CORE proposed the \"Freedom Rides.\" CORE felt that \\nthey could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby \\ncreating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to \\nintervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE \\nmembers knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE \\ndirector James Farmer maintained they were ready.  \"When we \\nbegan the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much \\nviolence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the \\npossibility of death.\"\\n  \\n------------------------------------------------------------ \\n\\n            * S E X...S E X...S E X...S E X *\\n            NOW THAT WE\\x92VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION...\\n\\nIntroducing GREAT SEX -- the ONLY pill of its kind fortified \\nwith nature\\'s most POTENT MOOD ENHANCERS.

In the upper \\nsouth they met no resistance but by the time they got to \\nAlabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who \\nslashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was \\nworse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well \\naware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were \\nthe Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, \\nand when they arrived they were severely beaten. \\n\\nDespite the warnings there were no police to protect them. \\nGovernor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. \\nSo the terrorist attacks went on. The \"Freedom Riders\" were \\ndetermined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-\\nville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested \\nand sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and \\nimmediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the \\njourney.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------ \\n\\n   ---------> The Paranormal Insider Is Here! <---------\\n\\nShagMail is PROUD to introduce our one and only paranormal \\ninvestigator, Gus.

State officials had promised Attorney General Robert \\nKennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached \\nMontgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, \\nthe riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, \\nbravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. \\nHe still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-\\ndeniable. Others including Justice Department official John \\nSeigenthaler were also beaten.\\n\\nThe situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-\\nvention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-\\ning martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off \\nperiod but the riders refused. They would continue on. So \\nthey set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a \\ndeal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be \\nprotected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had \\ncaved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General \\nand the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising \\ntheir constitutional rights. They never finished their trip \\nbut their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and \\nin the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be \\ndefeated. It is another example of how people change things, \\nnot government officials.\\n\\nSources: Eyes on the Prize\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------ \\nQuestions...Comments..Email us at: mailto:denis@shagmail.com \\n<a href=\"mailto:denis@shagmail.com\">Email Forgotten History</a> \\n************************************************************ \\n\\nTo SUBSCRIBE visit: http://www.shagmail.com/sub/history.html \\n*** \\nTo UNSUBSCRIBE visit: http://www.shagmail.com/unsub/history.html \\n*** \\nWant some Fun and Amusements in your email box FREE!

Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All\\n\\nOctober 2, 2002\\nBy LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nApparently it fell into the category \"too good to check.\"\\n\\n\\nLast Friday, several British newspapers reported that the\\nWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blonds\\nwould become extinct within 200 years, because blondness\\nwas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The\\nreports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News\\nprogram \"Good Morning America,\" and on Saturday by CNN. \\n\\nThere was only one problem, the health organization said in\\na statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds\\nwould become extinct, and it had never done a study on the\\nsubject. \\n\\n\"W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports\\noriginated,\" said the organization, an agency of the United\\nNations based in Geneva, \"but would like to stress that we\\nhave no opinion of the future existence of blonds.\" \\n\\nAll the news reports, in Britain and the United States,\\ncited a study from the World Health Organization - \"a\\nblonde-shell study,\" as The Daily Star of London put it.\\nBut none reported any scientific details from the study or\\nthe names of the scientists who conducted it. \\n\\nOn \"Good Morning America,\" Charles Gibson began a\\nconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:\\n\"There\\'s a study from the World Health Organization, this\\nis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women\\nand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural\\nblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth\\nwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as\\nbrunets.\" \\n\\nMs. Sawyer said she was \"somewhat of a natural blonde.\"\\n\\n\\nJeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the\\nanchors got the information from an ABC producer in London\\nwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. \\n\\nIn London, The Sun and The Express both reported that\\nunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in\\nScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected\\nthe last true blond to hail from Finland. \\n\\nThe British accounts were replete with the views of\\nbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow\\nblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare\\ngenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an\\nendangered species. \\n\\nJournalists in London said last night that the source of\\nthe reports was probably one of several European news\\nagencies that are used by the British press, but it\\nremained unclear which one. \\n\\nTim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the\\nreport was probably distributed by The Press Association,\\nBritain\\'s domestic news agency. \"Several papers picked it\\nup,\" he said. \\n\\nBut Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press\\nAssociation, said that although it had considered running\\nthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking\\nto the World Health Organization. \\n\\n\"We didn\\'t do that story because we made an inquiry to the\\nWorld Health Organization first,\" she said. \"They told us\\nthat report was two years old, and had been covered at the\\ntime. They said it had been picked up again that day by a\\nGerman news agency.\" \\n\\nShe added that she did not know which agency the\\norganization was referring to. \\n\\nDr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California\\nat San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for\\nblond hair \"sounds patently incorrect.\"\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02BLON.html?ex=1034599071&ei=1&en=3a0e4f0b2b251593\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.html\\nDate: Not supplied\\n\\nWe\\'re trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. \\nHistorically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get \\nabused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything \\nthey think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. \\nEnd result: people don\\'t enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not \\ncapturing all that information. You can always \"page fault\" to get the \\ninformation if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in \\nevery bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine \\n(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be \\nrelevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the \\nprogrammer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be \\ndll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking \\nfor the DLL info? Similarly, it\\'s always tempting to add a field in which you \\nask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but \\ntrust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing \\nonly: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first \\nplace. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can \\nalways include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be \\nrelevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on \\nWindows 98SE? Aha! You can\\'t. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not \\nevery bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so \\nthis search doesn\\'t make sense in the first place. The info wasn\\'t captured. Do \\na full text search for 98SE and you\\'ll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) \\n\\nLife would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of \\ninformation -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on \\nthe computer in question and while you\\'re at it, a photograph of the tester\\'s \\nworkspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, \\nwhich, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I \\nhave heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking \\npackage was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the \\nsystem, because they didn\\'t know what all those fields were. The _real_ \\nbug-\"tracking\" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. \\n\\nA pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, \"does \\nFogBUGZ support custom fields?\" Rather than giving our usual answer (\"no. on \\npurpose.\") over the last few weeks I\\'ve been saying, \"can you please tell me \\nwhat fields you would need? We\\'re trying to decide whether to implement that \\nfeature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it.\" The interesting thing \\nis, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the \\nother ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn\\'t be fields. And in fact, our \\nexisting customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our \\nbiggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted \\nto add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, \\nbut I didn\\'t, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track \\nof it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are \\nhappy and keep buying more site licenses. \\n\\nBut the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking \\nsoftware and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in \\nour product. \"Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields.\" Righto. It\\'s true. And \\nwho am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to \\nyesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a \\nbuilt-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and \\ninconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But \\nit\\'s still rude of me to tell customers that we don\\'t have that feature _for \\ntheir own good_, even though it usually is, and we\\'re losing some sales because \\nof it. \\n\\nSigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so \\nhard to use that people don\\'t use it. At least we won\\'t lose any sales :)\\n\\n[1] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ\\n\\n\\n',\n",

In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977.

Since this development,we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim. To this effect,I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every documentto be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines,\\nSo you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money\\nwill be for you, 10%for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be\\ndonated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues\\nand I.

Recently, in private email, \\nErnest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this \\nin-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) \\nlicensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many \\nways encouraged. \\n\\n*Tools:*\\n1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)\\n1 Monsters, Inc. Collector\\'s Edition DVD (any DVD should work)\\n1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 \"Jaguar\" \\n\\n*Process:*\\n1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for \\nyou.\\n2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to \\nyour hard drive. Ejct the DVD.\\n3. In DVD Player, select \"Open VIDEO_TS Folder...\" from the File menu. Use the \\ndialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. \\n\\nNow the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I \\ncould also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could \\nshare it via a P2P network. And I haven\\'t done anything to decrypt the DVD or \\nviolate the DMCA: I\\'ve used only basic tools available to all normal computer \\nusers on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. \\n\\n*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, \\nfinds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not \\nsure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, \\nplease let me know. However, if it is true, then it\\'s very interesting that \\nDisney has released such a major movie without encryption.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Since they\\nstart with \"#\" they are ignored in the final compilation.\\n\\nRegarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel\\nsoftware to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. \\nI recall from your previous mail that there was a flag\\n    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4\\nwhich could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate\\ndirectory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to\\npersuade the code to compile against the correct headers.

All of those who\\nperished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers\\nand a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic\\namenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish\\nthat those senseless acts of terror created for the victims\\' families and,\\nindeed, for all of us.\\n\\nBut for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square\\nfeet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers\\nmust be replaced on the site.\\n\\nAbout 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,\\nalong with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.\\nTogether, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the\\neconomic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%\\nof the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms\\nhave relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New\\nYork City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit\\nmay become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.\\n\\nIf we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the\\nvibrancy it had as the world\\'s financial center. Love them or hate them,\\nand there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers\\nmade a powerful statement to the world that said, \"This is New York, a\\nsymbol of our free economy and of our way of life.\" That is why they were\\ndestroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and\\nwith buildings that make a potent architectural statement.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many\\nsources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on\\nall of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square\\nfeet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or\\nsimply never rebuilt.\\n\\nThese proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be\\nrecovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over\\nthe towers\\' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the\\noffice and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.\\n\\nAccess to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.\\nThat was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy\\nbefore 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has\\nremotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway\\nand PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements\\nplanned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct\\n\"Train-to-the-Plane\" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes\\neven more the logical locus of office development.\\n\\nAnd New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task\\nforce of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury\\nSecretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60\\nmillion square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the\\nanticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only\\nheightens the need.\\n\\nAs for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown\\ncannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that\\nhistory shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of\\noffice space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased\\nup. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the\\nbeginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,\\nat an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.\\n\\nWe are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site\\nover a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on\\nline until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an\\nannual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s\\'\\nrate.\\n\\nThose who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it\\npreviously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an\\nextended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor\\nwill most New Yorkers.\\n\\nMayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times\\nthat the city \"has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the\\nfuture.\" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --\\nand that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural\\nsignificance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what\\nhappened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as\\nresidents of the area.\\n\\nThe challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.\\n\\nMr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm\\nwhose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR.

(And, with a good enough sales pitch, you\\njust might get away with it!)\\n\\nHowever, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must \\nprovide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might\\nbuy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell\\nthat binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I\\'ll need to provide\\nthe sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just\\nmight make money at this, since there might be a market of\\n10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of\\ngetting a binary.\\n\\nBut then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for\\n1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite\\n/bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of\\nthe media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is.\\n\\nYou see, the GPL doesn\\'t force the binaries to be zero-cost\\n(or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any\\nbusiness plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_\\ncharge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be\\nproviding some value for that money, or you\\'ll go out of\\nbusiness faster than a dot-com in 2001.\\n\\nAnd there are real ways to provide this value for money\\n(convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a\\nfriendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates,\\nconvenience of having what lots of other people have,\\nposting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading\\nover a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from\\na \"real\" company, etc).\\n\\nThere will be segments of the market that will pay various\\namounts for GPL software and there will be others that don\\'t.\\nThankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.

The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do\\nwith Dr. Rajcoomar.\\n\\nTwo U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back\\nto coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight\\nman who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer\\nrefused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying\\nout for the lead roles in Hollywood\\'s latest action extravaganza.\\n\\nThey handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him\\nin a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite\\njittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight\\nattendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,\\nalready scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were\\nnot ready to let things quiet down.\\n\\nOne of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The\\nmarshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and\\nremain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any\\nreason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try\\nto visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who\\ndisobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.\\n\\nThe passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were\\nterrorists on the plane.\\n\\n\"I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized\\ncabin,\" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of\\nCommon Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an\\naisle seat in coach. \"I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire\\nin a shootout.\"\\n\\nDr. Rajcoomar\\'s wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her\\nhusband, said, \"It was really like Rambo in the air.\" She worried that\\nthere might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore\\ndid not understand the marshals\\' orders. If someone got up to go to the\\nbathroom, he or she might be shot.\\n\\nThere were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When\\nthe plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into\\ncustody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals\\ngrabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that\\nanyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where\\nhe was thrown into a filthy cell.\\n\\nThis was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.\\nRajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.\\n\\nDr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into\\ncustody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening\\nhours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.\\n\\nOfficials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were\\neventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.\\nMcCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,\\nwhich is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.\\n\\nThe Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the\\nincident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.\\nRajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident \"too\\nclosely.\"\\n\\nIf that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters\\nare headed for jail.\\n\\nDr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. \"I\\nhad never been treated like that in my life,\" he said. \"I was afraid that I\\nwas about to be beaten up or killed.\"\\n\\nLawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and\\nhe has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful\\ndetention.\\n\\n\"We have to take a look at what we\\'re doing in the name of security,\" said\\nDr. Rajcoomar. \"So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in\\nthis great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of\\nsecurity.\"\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR.

However, I watch the Frontline show \"Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero\" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.\\nI am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).\\nThanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program.

And the bandwidth shadows in most cities\\nare surprisingly large and common.  They aren\\'t selling the software, which\\nis pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next\\ngeneration wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large\\nscale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless\\nconfigurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and\\nothers which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit\\nconsiderations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize\\nthe canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless\\nis tied into fiber at multiple points.\\n\\nThe canopies we are talking about aren\\'t short-range wifi technologies, but\\na mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth\\nmeasured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to\\nwell over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and\\nbandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an\\norder of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and\\nproximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the\\ncost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers\\ncan remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low\\nbar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of\\nlarge-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective\\nbandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company\\'s\\nlong-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to\\nkeep things sane.\\n\\nOr at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,\\nespecially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the\\nsystem (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more\\nefficient).\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Powell Chairman Federal Communications\\nCommission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554\\n\\n\\nBY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL\\n\\nDear Chairman Powell:\\n\\nI am writing to you today in regards to the digital television\\nBroadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings\\'\\nand Representatives Dingell and Tauzin\\'s letters of July 19, which\\nurged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the\\nfinal report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group.\\n\\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported\\nnon-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties\\ninterests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical\\nrole in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the\\nInternet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction\\non strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that\\nInternet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;\\nand defending academics, researchers and commercial interests\\nagainst DMCA-related prosecution.\\n\\nEFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion\\nGroup. We attended the group\\'s meetings and conference calls and\\nparticipated in the group\\'s policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF\\nalso maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of\\ninformation on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The\\nsite can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted\\nthousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of\\nthe BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy\\ngroups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose\\nproducts were threatened by the proceedings.\\n\\nWhen you and I met at Esther Dyson\\'s PC Forum last March, we spoke\\nbriefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined\\nby the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group\\'s mandate. The BPDG\\nproposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free\\nexpression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it\\nwill add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,\\ncompromising DTV adoption itself.\\n\\nAs you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured\\nthose devices they believed would be successful in the market, often\\nin spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to\\nthe PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever\\nproducts they believe the public will pay for; what\\'s more,\\ninnovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest\\nregulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious\\nfew regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products\\nthat interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to\\nthe PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to\\nshipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member\\ncompanies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,\\nwhether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until\\nhe has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to\\nthe Hollywood studios for review.\\n\\nConsumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the \"Open\\nSource\" or \"Free Software\" movement, in which technologies are\\ndistributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From\\nserver-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating\\nsystems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla\\nbrowser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer\\nbenefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans\\nFree Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer\\nand the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these\\napplications are built to be modified by end-users, something that\\nis banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component\\nof the BPDG\\'s \"Robustness Requirements\" will create and entire class\\nof illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First\\nAmendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive\\nspeech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source\\nlicenses.\\n\\nThe BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright\\nline that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability\\nwhen deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG\\nwas a \"standard\" that contained no objective criteria for legal\\ntechnology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be\\napproved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only\\ntechnologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only\\nlegal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C\\nconsortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA\\'s\\nallies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort\\nof regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies\\nwill be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by\\nallying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain\\ntechnologies and outlaw others.\\n\\nThe marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently\\nproducing products that increase the value and desirability of new\\ntechnologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market\\nfor DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV\\ntechnology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to\\nmarket if they failed to assuage the MPAA\\'s concerns about\\nunauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of\\nunauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down\\nto the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability\\nof the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television\\nprogramming has been an historical force for increasing the value of\\nbroadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR.\\n\\nIronically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate\\nwould do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only\\nslow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while\\nreducing the number of desirable features that an open market would\\ncreate. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,\\nthey will not flock to DTV.\\n\\nThe most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there\\nis neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool\\nfor protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be\\neffective in that role. The existing practice of Internet\\ninfringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from\\ndevices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would\\nnot be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.\\nHigher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to\\ndetermined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal\\nfrom DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single\\ngeneration\\'s worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters\\nthe Internet.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that\\ninfringement will undermine Hollywood\\'s business to the point that\\nmovies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value\\nof DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or\\nanalysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to\\nCongress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The\\npublic is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry\\nis being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of\\nentertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate\\nextraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion\\ntechnology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few\\nstudio executives.\\n\\nEFF welcomes the FCC\\'s oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The\\nBPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a\\nlooking-glass \"public process\" where only those participants the\\norganizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,\\nwhere the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit\\nthe needs of the entertainment interests and the technology\\ncompanies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly\\nfor their products, where the press was banned.\\n\\nThe FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public\\nopinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,\\nEFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the\\nBPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,\\nThomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including\\nEFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free\\nSoftware Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the\\nCenter for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and\\nCommunications Industry Association.\\n\\nThank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can\\nbe of any further assistance to you.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\nCory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\n\\n\\n\\nLinks: \\n\\nEFF\\'s BPDG Blog: \\nhttp://bpdg.blogs.eff.org \\n\\nAn overview of our concerns with the broadcast flag:\\nhttp://bpdg.blogs.eff.org/archives/one-page.pdf \\n\\nLetter from Sen.

Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme\\nCourt. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,\\n2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six\\noccasions sent e-mail critical of Intel\\'s employment practices to\\nbetween 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi\\nstop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi\\nfrom e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,\\nbased on the common-law tort of \"trespass to chattels.\" (\"Chattel\"\\nis a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to\\nproperty in land.)\\n\\nEFF\\'s amicus brief argues three main points.\\n\\n(1) Intel did not qualify for relief under \"trespass to chattels\"\\nbecause Intel\\'s e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by\\nHamidi\\'s e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of\\nHamidi\\'s e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the\\ne-mails affected the functioning of Intel\\'s servers.\\n\\n(2) By focusing on unwanted \"contact\" with the chattel and ignoring\\nthe harm requirement, the court of appeal turned \"trespass to\\nchattels\" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity\\nlike search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a\\n\"no trespassing\" sign, any \"contact\" by a search engine could be\\nconsidered a trespass even if it caused no harm.\\n\\n(3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not\\ninfringe Hamidi\\'s freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits\\nprivate parties\\' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,\\nout of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress\\ncriticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel\\'s\\nclaims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi\\'s speech.\\n\\n\\nLinks: \\n\\nThe Intel v.

It is now\\nscheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the\\nfall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content\\nscrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort\\nto build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of\\n2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen\\nwith a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which\\noutlaws breaking into a third-party\\'s property in order to steal\\ndata that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first\\ntime the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his\\nown property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if\\nconvicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by\\nthe Motion Picture Association.\\n\\nThe trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of \\n2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified \\njudges to hear Johansen\\'s case.  Now the case is scheduled to be \\nheard by a three-judge panel.

Huang\\'s paper \"shows how a\\nperson could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,\"\\nsaid MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang\\'s advisors. \"More\\nimportantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a\\ngeneral design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems\\nsuch as the government\\'s Clipper Chip and the movie industry\\'s\\nContents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players.\"\\n\\nHuang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his\\npreliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.\\nWith the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked\\nwith Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal\\nissues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang\\'s research\\nfindings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by\\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\\n\\nMicrosoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the\\npaper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to\\nwithhold the paper.\\n\\n\"Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control\\npublication,\" said Abelson. \"Their response shows that they value\\nacademic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of\\nunfettered research and publication in advancing technology.\"\\n\\nOther companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten\\nresearchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year\\nwarned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team\\nexposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last\\nmonth, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft\\nover exposing a security vulnerability in HP\\'s Tru64 Unix operating\\nsystem. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to\\nstifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve\\ncomputer security.\\n\\nHuang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,\\n\"The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to\\nsubmit my research for peer review until after the EFF\\'s efforts to\\nclear potential legal restraints.\"\\n\\n\"Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about\\ngetting sued,\" said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.\\n\\nLinks:\\n\\nFor this release:\\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/20020808_eff_bunnie_pr.html\\n\\nFor Huang\\'s paper:\\nftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/2002/AIM-2002-008.pdf\\n\\nFor the CHES program: http://islab.oregonstate.edu/ches/program.html\\n\\nEFF \"Unintended Consequences: Three Years Under the DMCA\" report:\\nhttp://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/20020503_dmca_consequences.pdf\\n\\nRIAA sues Professor Edward Felten over SDMI:\\nhttp://www.eff.org/Legal/Cases/Felten_v_RIAA/\\n\\nAn article about Hewlett-Packard\\'s threatening SnoSoft:\\nhttp://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,54297,00.html\\n\\n- end -\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n* EFF Thanks Defcon\\n\\nEFF thanks The Dark Tangent and other organizers of the DEF CON X\\nconvention for their generous donation of exhibition space at DEF\\nCON (http://www.defcon.org/).

       " 'This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general\\ndealing-with-SPAM issue.\\n\\nWhat is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?\\nThere are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the \\'MAIL\\nFROM\\' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think\\nmost people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a \"permanent\" error. That\\npretty much means, \"Don\\'t bother to try from that address again,\\nyou\\'ll get the same error.\" People often add cathartic messages to\\naccompany the 550 like, \"Spammers must die.\"\\n\\nBut this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers\\nthat you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to\\nget around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?\\nThat is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but\\nthen just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how\\nSpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP\\ntransaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is\\ngoing fine and has no reason to try new methods.\\n\\nThen there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code\\nindicating you\\'re on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is\\nsaying \"mailbox does not exist.\" This would be in the hopes that some\\nspammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from\\ntheir lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can\\nlower the incidence.\\n\\nSo, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of\\nthe bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be\\nhuge. Personally, I\\'m starting to think blackholes are the way to\\ngo... But sending back that \"Spammer die, die, die,\" or stock \"Access\\nDEE-NIED!\" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)\\n-- \\nCrist J.

Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN\\nSPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return\\naddress to facilitate consumers\\' removal from spam lists. It would\\nplace enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and\\nstate Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service\\nProviders (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.\\nIt would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.\\n\\nThe Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and\\nreported it out largely unchanged.  It\\'s not now scheduled for further\\naction in the Senate.\\n\\nCAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to\\nmore spam, not less.

Yesterday\\'s vote will turn\\nEurope into a virtual \"spam-free zone\" after the formal adoption of the\\ndirective, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or\\nother similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not\\nhave a preexisting business relationship.\\n\\n\"This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,\" said EuroCAUCE\\nChairman George Mills. \"We are extremely pleased that the European\\nParliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added\\nthe right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the\\nprivacy of Europeans.\"\\n\\nWhile six European Union member countries had already formalized \"opt-in\"\\nin their national laws and regulations, yesterday\\'s vote should turn all\\nof Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, the rest of the world\\'s Internet-using countries,\\nincluding the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection\\nof Internet users,\" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. \"This is\\na tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow\\nEurope\\'s lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and\\nnetwork owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail\\nadvertising.\"\\n\\n\"This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the\\nEuropean Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the\\nEuropean Parliament listening to their constituents,\" said Mills. \"Our\\nmembers and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,\\ntranslating, lobbying and educating their representatives.\"\\n\\nMore information on the E.U. directive is available on the European\\nParliament\\'s Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,\\nand a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at\\n<http://www.euro.cauce.org/en/amendments1a.html>.

       " 'the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the\\nuniverse. too big to decrypt.\\n\\nmy point is there will never be a \"safe\" key. what I would consider is how\\nlong does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for\\nlonger than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to\\nstop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what\\nis available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do not\\nrelease the data to the public.\\n\\nI have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking\\nthe key gives away it\\'s secret.\\n\\nthe tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP\\nfor example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the\\nnightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we\\nneeded to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac\\'s sold after the\\nXP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.\\n\\nthe new Audio CD\\'s that have digital copy protection so not play on my\\ncomputer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me\\nreturn them and get my money back.\\n\\nthe more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.\\n\\njef\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to\\njust run Amithlon (or if that wasn\\'t so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!\\n\\nThis is a near-term thing I could look forward to!\\n\\nHowever, an \\'official\\' laptop seems unexciting to me with only\\nthe items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing\\nthe listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:\\n1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the\\n   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is\\n   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would\\n   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.\\n   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics\\n   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,\\n   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and\\n    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)\\n\\n1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of \\'internet keys\\'\\n    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll\\n    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.\\n\\n1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)\\n    in BIOS, please.\\n\\n2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan\\n   to pull air through it, and if you don\\'t elevate thelaptop off\\n   the desk or table or bed it\\'s on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good\\n  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you\\'ve got an\\n  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)\\n     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs\\n  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display\\n  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion\\n  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)\\n      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative\\n  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle\\n  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally\\n  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them\\n  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides\\n  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little\\n  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep\\n  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) \\n\\n3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the\\n    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to\\n    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but\\n    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified\\n   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the\\n   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with\\n   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides\\n   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted\\n   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.\\n     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,\\n   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see\\n   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of \\'indian red\\' that are great\\n   candidates) base.  \\n      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight\\n    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-\\n    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare\\n    hood) to feed\\n    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent \\n    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.\\n      The logo should be a coloration of a\\n   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew\\n   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/\\n   at first blush.  We\\'ll see what comes out of the contest and\\n   maybe you\\'ll like the mapping MathCAD does of the\\n   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the\\n   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.\\n   MAA.org has more references, I\\'m sure.\\n\\n4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.\\n\\nOther details:\\nUSB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that\\'s unavailable.\\nOptions like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port\\nshould round out the offering.  An option for just-released \\n.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more\\nreviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,\\nand almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.\\nCompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card\\ninterfaces would be very pleasant.  I\\'ve mentioned booting to\\nUSB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.\\nTo that end, a backup solution with compression using\\nUSB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice \\nbundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....\\n\\n\\nBlue skies (and clear water and fresh air): \\nWaterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.\\nSvelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,\\nbuiltin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and \\nfrontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map\\nand various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that\\nsays \\'This is Amiga Speaking\\' when stroked \\'round. \\nDecent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps \\nan ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as \\nkeyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.\\n2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple \\n18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our\\n(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.\\nActual 7\" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation \\nfan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade\\nRunner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling\\nand airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user\\nseat and provide mineral water.\\nHyperTransport ports.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I grew up in the 70\\x92s & 80\\x92s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!\\nse!\\n, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nRJ\\x94\\n\\nLocation: Midwest, U.S.A.\\n\\n\\x93Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.\\x94\\n\\n-- Frankie R.\\n\\nLocation: West Coast, USA\\n\\n\\x93I\\x92m a man of my 40\\x92s and I really know my stuff.

It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70\\x92s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.

       " \"SpamAssassin is hurting democracy!\\nOwen\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nhttp://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htm\\n\\nInternet can level the political playing field\\nBy Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro\\n\\nNOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one \\nof the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping \\nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \\nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \\npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \\npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \\nask for our votes.\\n\\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \\nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\\n\\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \\nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \\naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \\neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\\n\\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \\nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \\nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \\n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\\n\\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \\nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \\nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \\nthrough any of those channels.\\n\\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \\nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \\nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \\nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \\n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\\n\\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \\nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \\nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \\nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \\nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\\n\\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \\nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \\nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \\nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\\n\\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \\nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \\nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \\nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \\nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \\nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \\ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\\n\\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \\nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \\nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \\npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \\naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\\n\\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \\nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \\nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \\ngroups.\\n\\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \\nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \\nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \\nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \\nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \\nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \\nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \\nadvocacy management and communications software company.

       " \"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516333\\nDate: Not supplied\\n\\nAll through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is \\nhosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival: \\n\\n    Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema \\n\\n    In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been \\n    constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric \\n    permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies \\n    that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers \\n    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest \\n    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming \\n    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce \\n    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics \\n    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances \\n    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the \\n    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of \\n    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James \\n    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary \\n    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry \\n    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish \\n    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, \\n    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously \\n    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, \\n    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to \\n    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no \\n    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to \\n    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!  \\n\\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Jef[3]!_)\\n\\n[1] http://www.msri.org/20thanniversary/cinemath.html\\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/Adiw2xL5kw8ug\\n[3] http://www.acme.com\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nTCPA and Palladium: Content Control for the Masses\\n\\nWhile security experts poke and jab at what bits and pieces\\nof the TCPA and Palladium specs they can get ahold of, they\\nhave tended to focus on how they work and what they imply as\\nfar as concerns such as privacy and security go, or\\nalternatively, in terms of how they would impact the\\nfunctionality of the general purpose logic device.  Analysts\\nboth favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from\\nthese standpoints, while paying much less attention to what\\nthe proposals imply from the standpoint of what content\\ncontrol itself really means.\\n\\nThe most significant problem with TCPA and Palladium is not\\nwhether they may interfere with the power of the universal\\nlogic device, or whether they are effectual from the\\nstandpoint of privacy and security concerns, though these\\nare all very important concerns.  Rather, the fundamental\\nproblem they present is in the political premises that they\\nhope to implement for the sake of the \"content industries.\"\\n\\nTCPA and Palladium are the technological realization of the\\nconcepts embodied in the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\\nTreaty (WPPT), which only came into effect this past May\\n20th (with little public notice or fanfare, of course).  The\\nWPPT declares an unprecedented \"moral right\" of authors to\\ncontrol public uses of their works.\\n\\n*That\\'s* the real game plan.\\n\\nTCPA and Palladium are simply content control for the\\nmasses.  They constitute an effort to \"democratize\" content\\ncontrol under the concept of \"moral rights,\" encouraging the\\npublic to overlook the clear public interest issues raised\\nby the specter of content control, and to confuse these\\nissues with private interest issues such as privacy and\\nsecurity.  They are an effort to get the public to jump on\\nthe bandwagon without adequate consideration of what\\'s\\nreally on the line.\\n\\nIn America, we have never supported the concept of \"moral\\nrights\" which the WPPT professes.  The US Constitution\\naccords Congress the power to grant (or deny) exclusive\\nrights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting\\nthe progress of the useful arts and sciences, not for the\\npurpose of rewarding the originality of creators -- though\\nthat result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights\\nstatutes such as copyright law.  Our Supreme Court\\nexplicitly articulates this distinction, and for very good\\nreason.  In America, we implicitly understand the\\ndistinction between expression, the aspect of works to which\\ncopyright statute applies, and the facts and ideas that make\\nup a work, to which it does *not* apply.\\n\\nThe reason for this is essential and unavoidable, and must\\nbe stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture:\\ninformation is free.  It\\'s not that it *wants* to be -- it\\n*is* and it always has been.  This fact is unassailable,\\nhowever, unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes\\nto \"universal content control\" for the sake of so-called\\n\"moral rights\" implemented at the behest of narrow content\\nindustry interests.\\n\\nTCPA and Palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage\\nthe general public, and more specifically producers of\\ninformation products in general, to identify content control\\nwith \"moral rights,\" blithely overlooking the real\\nimplications of information technology in a free society,\\nand the long tradition of American jurisprudence upholding\\nthe freedom intrinsic to information, a freedom on which the\\nprospects of information technology crucially depend.\\n\\nSeth Johnson\\n\\n-- \\n\\n[CC] Counter-copyright:\\nhttp://cyber.law.harvard.edu/cc/cc.html\\n\\nI reserve no rights restricting copying, modification or\\ndistribution of this incidentally recorded communication. \\nOriginal authorship should be attributed reasonably, but\\nonly so far as such an expectation might hold for usual\\npractice in ordinary social discourse to which one holds no\\nclaim of exclusive rights.\\n\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I\\'ve always found archaeology interesting for no\\nparticular reason.  Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I\\nactually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\nhttp://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htm\\n\\nDefrosting the past\\n\\nAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty\\nof a warming world\\n\\nBY ALEX MARKELS\\n\\nAs he hiked near Colorado\\'s Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed\\nKnapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000\\nfeet. \"It looked like a bison skull,\" the building contractor and\\namateur archaeologist recalls. \"I thought, \\'That\\'s strange. Bison don\\'t\\nlive this high up.\\' \"\\n\\nKnapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,\\nwhere scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a\\nbison\\x96one that died about 340 years ago. \"This was an extraordinary\\ndiscovery,\" says Russ Graham, the museum\\'s chief curator, adding that it\\ncould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. \"There\\'s\\nprobably a lot more like it yet to be found.\"\\n\\nAnd not just bison. Colorado isn\\'t the only place where glaciers and\\nsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru\\nto Alaska\\x96a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and\\nindustry\\x96have shrunk or thawed many of the world\\'s 70,000 glaciers. As\\nthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is\\nemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep\\nfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky\\nfringes of the ice are revising scientists\\' understanding of our\\npredecessors\\' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.\\n\\n\"It\\'s mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through\\nstudying these remains,\" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude\\narchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic\\nSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered\\nin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old \"Ice\\nMan,\" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have\\noffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as\\nthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional\\ntreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.\\n\\nVanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother\\nNature\\x96and looters\\x96take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can\\ndeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they\\'re\\noften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them\\ndon\\'t even realize they\\'re ancient.\\n\\nThat was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in\\nBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a\\ndead animal. \"It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,\"\\nrecalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. \"But when I looked\\ncloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.\"\\n\\nFiguring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur\\ntrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc\\nbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed\\nthe fallen hunter\\'s body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what\\nseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter\\nlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts\\'inchi, or Long Ago\\nPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who\\nmay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human\\nfrom the period ever found in North America.\\n\\nOther findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could\\nexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the\\nfirst place. \"Before this there was no archaeological record of people\\nliving here,\" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. \"Now we\\nsee that this area was very much part of people\\'s seasonal activities.\"\\n\\nLike Ward\\'s discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek\\ncaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,\\nGerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south\\nYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in\\ncaribou dung. \"It was really odd, because I knew there hadn\\'t been\\ncaribou in the area for at least 100 years,\" recalls Kuzyk, then a\\nwildlife biologist with the Yukon government.\\n\\nCaribou cake. Returning a week later, he found \"what looked like a\\npencil with string wrapped around it.\" It turned out to be a\\n4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the\\nice patch\\x96and scores of others around the region\\x96revealed icy layer\\ncakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800\\nyears of changing hunting practices.\\n\\nScientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the\\nice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.\\nHunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded\\nsome equipment in the ice. \"We\\'ve got people hunting with throwing darts\\nup until 1,200 years ago,\" says Hare, who now oversees the research\\nproject. \"Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about\\n1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there\\'s no more throwing\\ndarts.\"\\n\\nNow scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They\\nare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where\\nglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to\\nhave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska\\'s Wrangell\\nand St. Elias mountain ranges\\x96the United States\\' most glaciated\\nterrain\\x96and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing\\nEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as\\nthe Ice Man. \"Global warming is providing us high-altitude\\narchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We\\'re\\nprobably about the only ones happy about it.\"\\n\\n\\n',\n",

This -is- a First Amendment issue.\\nPublic streets, provided one isn\\'t blocking traffic, generally tend to\\nbe sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few\\nyears ago (I\\'ll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have\\nchanged, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy\\n_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the\\npro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn\\'t do enough\\nof a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.\\n\\nI\\'ll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.\\nIf I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably\\nassemble against Bush, do you think they\\'ll give me a permit?\\nProbably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this\\nscenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I\\nfalsified my statement to get this said document.

Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to\\nchose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting\\ndown has grown to become the answer because the government, over a\\nspan of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the\\nrights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you\\nquestion the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in\\ngeneral, you\\'re aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of\\nthe folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you\\'re an\\nanarchist, and you\\'re herded off to a \\'designated protest spot\\' miles\\naway from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.\\nI can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats\\nspeech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting\\nover the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other\\nway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGAB> I think that given the information as laid out by the story,\\nGAB> Mr. O\\'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free\\nGAB> speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost \\nGAB> every American seems to involve the ability to communicate\\nGAB> an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing\\nGAB> a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience\\nGAB> that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical \\nGAB> effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. \\n\\nGetting back to my original point.  How do you communicate  an idea to\\nan unknown audience, if you\\'re miles from where the audience is?   How\\ndo you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience\\nwithout violating the rules of the regime?  I don\\'t think Mr. Nell was\\nthrowing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn\\'t cause\\nphysical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.\\nCalifornia, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that\\nhas the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has\\nthe option to leave.\\n\\n\\nJust my .02, while its still considered legal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nBest regards,\\n bitbitch                            mailto:bitbitch@magnesium.net\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'From: Donald Eastlake 3rd <dee3@torque.pothole.com>\\n\\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/16/science/space/16MOON.html>\\n\\nJuly 16, 2002\\nBy Yonder Blessed Moon, Sleuths Decode Life and Art\\nBy LEON JAROFF\\n\\nOn its way back from the Pacific island of Tinian, where it had\\ndelivered the uranium core for the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima,\\nthe heavy cruiser Indianapolis was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine\\nI-58 and sent to the bottom of the Philippine Sea. It was one of the\\nworst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200\\ncrew members survived.\\n\\nNow experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic\\nstory a startling new twist.\\n\\nIt was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they\\nwrite in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made\\nthe sinking possible.\\n\\nUsing astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as\\nwell as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the\\nsubmarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58\\nsurfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And,\\nthey said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds.\\n\\nLooking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship\\nsilhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six\\ntorpedoes sent it to the bottom.\\n\\n\"It was sheer chance,\" said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. \"Without\\nthat alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the\\ncruiser, especially at that distance.\"\\n\\nWith Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a\\nuniversity honors course called \"Astronomy in Art, History and\\nLiterature.\" In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place\\nof the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of\\nastronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the\\nmoon in military and other encounters.\\n\\nTwo years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright\\nstar in van Gogh\\'s \"White House at Night.\" He and some students went to\\nAuvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched\\nuntil they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters\\nfrom van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was\\ncompleted in June 1890.\\n\\nNoting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where\\nvan Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed,\\nand from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had\\nbeen illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then\\nidentified the \"star.\" It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June\\nhad occupied that part of the sky.\\n\\nA final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van\\nGogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the\\nmiddle of the month that year.\\n\\nDr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the\\nopening of \"Hamlet,\" when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the\\n\"star that\\'s westward from the pole had made his course to illume that\\npart of heaven where now it burns.\" From the guards\\' description, the\\nseason and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright\\nstars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson\\'s calculations placed it in the\\nconstellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars.\\n\\nPondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly\\ninspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho\\'s star,\\nfor the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia,\\ncreating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would\\ncertainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed\\nby the description of the supernova in a history book that was the\\nsource of some of his best-known plays.\\n\\nDr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that\\nnight was Tycho\\'s, and he has an impressive record of other\\nastronomy-based sleuthing.\\n\\nAware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his\\nnegatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic\\n\"Moon and Half Dome.\" At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found\\nAdams\\'s vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the\\nmoon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak\\nand other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at\\n4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960.\\n\\nThen, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical\\nat 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams\\'s daughter-in-law\\nvisited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of \"Moon and the\\nHalf Dome\" in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual\\nmoon and the Half Dome.\\n\\nAnalyzing Chaucer\\'s works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly\\nrapid movement of the moon described in \"The Merchant\\'s Tale\" occurred\\nin April 1389. And in \"The Franklin\\'s Tale,\" Chaucer\\'s description of\\nthe heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the\\nBrittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur\\nastronomer.\\n\\nThen there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride,\\nhow did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit\\nnight in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson\\'s computer program revealed that,\\nwhile the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the\\nsouthern horizon and did not illuminate Revere\\'s boat.\\n\\nDr. Olson\\'s proudest achievement was explaining \"the tide that failed\"\\nin the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943.\\nPlanners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over\\na reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with\\ndrafts of at least four feet, to pass.\\n\\nBut that day and the next, in the words of some observers, \"the ocean\\njust sat there,\" providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a\\nmean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge\\nof the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600\\nyards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun\\nfire from the Japanese.\\n\\nAsked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six\\nmonths researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the\\nmilitary planners were aware that they had to contend with a \"neap\"\\ntide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its\\nfirst or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes\\nwater levels to deviate less.\\n\\nBut that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth\\nand exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed\\nand the marines in trouble.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not in the least blaming the planners,\" Dr. Olson said, explaining\\nthat the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn\\'t been\\napplied to the waters at Tarawa.\\n\\nIndeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, \"We can\\ncalculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history.\"\\n\\nYet Dr. Olson\\'s greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his\\ninterdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. \"I have thought\\nabout van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,\" he says, \"and that has\\nmade my life as a scientist much richer.\"\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"Gooday,\\n\\nWith warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. \\n\\nIt will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. \\n\\nMy name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.\\n\\nWhen the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !\\n En!\\ngland for 9years now. \\n\\nI am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.\\n\\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. \\n\\nTo legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. \\n\\nFor valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.\\n\\nPlease, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. \\n\\nI look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\nDonald Phiri. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by:ThinkGeek\\nWelcome to geek heaven.\\nhttp://thinkgeek.com/sf\\n_______________________________________________\\nSpamassassin-Sightings mailing list\\nSpamassassin-Sightings@lists.sourceforge.net\\nhttps://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/spamassassin-sightings\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

By integrating the advanced\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors\\' secure P2P\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class\\n  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.\\n\\n  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this\\n  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around\\n  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience\\n  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how\\n  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between\\n  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple\\n  copies of constantly changing documents.\\n\\n  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of\\n  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit\\n  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than\\n  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured\\n  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also\\n  essential.\\n\\n  Endeavors\\' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for\\n  sharing information directly from people\\'s desktops. WebEx meetings can be\\n  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be\\n  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules\\n  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at\\n  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,\\n  inside or outside company firewalls.\\n\\n  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web\\n  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at\\n  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or\\n  \"present.\" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across\\n  other people\\'s Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents\\n  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx\\n  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,\\n  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.\\n\\n  \"In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed\\n  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,\" says\\n  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole\\'s group chief executive. \"The powerful combination\\n  of Endeavors\\' Magi and WebEx\\'s communications technologies will assist\\n  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by\\n  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.\"\\n\\n  \"WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,\\n  training, support and product design,\" says David Farrington, vice president\\n  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. \"By integrating the\\n  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors\\' secure\\n  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the\\n  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.\"\\n\\n  About Magi\\n  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms\\n  today\\'s Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration\\n  network of files and web resources.

This is the letter you \\nhave been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of \\nthis letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted \\nan entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see \\nif it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or \\nnot the program was legal. \\n\\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are \\'\\'absolutely NO Laws \\nprohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the \\nsimple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only \\n$25 out of pocket cost\\'\\'. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF \\nPOPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, \\nIT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. \\n\\nThis is what one had to say: \\'\\'Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I \\nwas approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am \\nso gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the \\nminimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ \\n610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.\" \\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. \\n\\n=================================================== \\n\\nHere is another testimonial: \"This program has been around for a long \\ntime but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again \\nin the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple \\ninstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. \\nFirst month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made \\na total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the \\nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The \\nkey to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change \\nanything.\\'\\' More testimonials later but first, \\n\\n===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTUREREFERENCE ====== \\n\\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ \\nIf you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and \\ncomfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! \\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ \\n\\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL \\nDREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: \\n\\n=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== \\n\\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT \\nYOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose \\nname appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN \\nADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail \\nproblems. \\n\\n=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. \\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer \\nand resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. \\n\\nWithin a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from \\nthese 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be \\naccessible for you to send to the 1,000\\'s of people who will order them \\nfrom you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in \\ncase something happen to your computer. \\n\\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next \\nto each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is \\ninstructed below in step \\'\\' 1 through 6 \\'\\' or you will loose out on majority \\nof your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see \\nhow it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been \\ntested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their \\nfriends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But \\nit does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then \\nnothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is \\ninstructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.\\n \\nRemember, honesty reaps the reward!!! \\n\\n1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and \\nREMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person \\nhas made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. \\n2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. \\n3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. \\n4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. \\n5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 \\n6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE \\nSURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! \\n\\n========================================================== \\n\\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your \\ncomputer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. \\nSave this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with \\nmarketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide \\nyou with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk \\ne-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. \\nThere are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: \\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY \\n\\n==========================================================\\n \\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will \\nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let\\'s \\nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response \\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people \\nwill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). \\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% \\nresponse, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded \\nby sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 \\ne-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That\\'s=100 people responded and \\nordered Report # 2\\n. \\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. \\nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. \\n\\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails \\nsent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\\n \\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 \\n(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report \\n# 5\\n THAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).\\n \\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 \\n... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 \\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT \\nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU \\nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !\\n \\n========================================================= \\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE \\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. \\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even \\none 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are \\nover 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, \\nmany people will do just that, and more! \\nMETHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \\n\\n======================================================= \\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds \\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will \\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 \\nand dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you \\nmust do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That\\'s it. Always provide \\nsame day service on all orders. \\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and \\naddress on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they \\nreceivethe report. \\n\\n=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== \\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: \\nAlways send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT \\naccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets \\nof paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME \\nof the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name \\nand postal address. \\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : \\n\\n==================================================== \\n\\nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider\\'s Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\" \\nOrder Report #1 from: \\n\\n A.

Ebert\\nR. R. #4\\nThamesford, Ontario, Canada\\nN0M 2M0\\n\\n____________________________________________________________ \\n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ \\n\\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success: \\n\\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 \\nweeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. \\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you \\nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, \\ncontinue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. \\n=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU \\nCAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the \\ncash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: \\nEvery time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front \\nof a Different report. \\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report \\npeople are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE \\nINCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START \\nTHE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. \\nThere is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! \\n\\n====================================================== \\n\\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS \\nPROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you \\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST \\nA LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next \\nfew weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program \\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works \\nexceedingly well as it is now. \\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put \\nyour name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 \\nas instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out \\n100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. \\nRemember though, the more you send out the more potential customers \\nyou will reach. \\nSo my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and \\nopportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! \\n\\n============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ \\n\\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an \\naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. \\nWhen I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving \\'\\'junk \\nmail\\'\\'. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population \\nand percentages involved. I \\'\\'knew\\'\\' it wouldn\\'t work. Jody totally ignored \\nmy supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I \\nmade merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \\'\\'I told you so\\'\\' on \\nher when the thing didn\\'t work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks \\nshe had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received \\ntotal $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked.

I deleted it, but later I wondered \\nif I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to \\nget another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone \\nelse.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not \\ndelete this one!

       " '\\n\\tAren\\'t Asian Pacfic Americans (APAs) accorded equal \\nopportunity already?  Unfortunately, no.  APAs are not accorded \\nequal opportunity in workplaces presently.  \\n\\n\\tEqual opportunity means: \"For every man, woman and \\nchild to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability \\nwill take them.\"  Statistics, mostly gathered by government \\nstudies, show that AAs have only 1/3 the opportunity of all \\nother Americans to rise to the top in the academic world, \\ncorporate world, the federal government.  There seems to exist \\nan invisible resistance to AAs\\' developing to the maximal of \\ntheir potentials  --  A Glass Ceiling.\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s look at a concrete case.  A lot of our best people are \\nemployed in universities.  Their average performance has been \\noutstanding.  What\\'s their chance of rising to the top?  \\n\\n\\tUniversity administrators are recruited almost exclusively \\nfrom the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in \\nuniversities.  Hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty + \\nprofessionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the \\nopportunity enjoyed by American citizens of different races.  \\nNationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-Hispanic) is 0.21.  That is, \\nfor every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black \\nadministrators.  The ratio for Native American is 0.20; for white \\n(non-Hispanic) is 0.16; and for Hispanic is 0.15.  However, it is \\nonly 0.06 for Asian American.  Get on the Web and check it out \\nfor yourself!  Source:  Dept. of Education - <www.ed.gov/NCES/ \\npubs/96323.html>, Table B-1f.\\n\\n\\tThe above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly \\n\"enlightened\" academic world.  The situation in the corporate \\nworld, state and federal governments is worse.  \\n\\n\\tIn E-Mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two \\nmajor political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and \\nhelp make our beloved nation \"a more perfect Union.\"   There has \\nalready been progress on account of that strategy.

However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the \"fraudulent assertions\" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.\" \\n\"A Honolulu-based attorney created the \"Kingdom of EnenKio\" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the \"kingdom\" has disputed.\" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) \\nThe purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with \"**\") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) \\nCorrection: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 \\nmiles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the \"fraudulent assertions\" of two organizations, ...** \\n(Comment: Just because the RMI government \"...has condemned the \\'fraudulent assertions\\' ...of ...EnenKio...\", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) \\n**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** \\n(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don\\'t even know what being a \"sister nation\" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn\\'t anybody check sources anymore?) \\nCorrection: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and \\nthe same could be said for DOM. \\n**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, \"...an article in Agence France-Presse\" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an \"...investment scam...\". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn\\'t anybody check sources anymore?) \\n**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** \\n(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no \"fraudulent claims\" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any \"..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of...\" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the \"Kingdom of EnenKio\" in the early 1990s.** \\n(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) \\nCorrection: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the \\nowner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** \\nCorrection: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made \\npossible by Murjel\\'s appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios\\' and the people\\'s behalf. \\n**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the \"kingdom\" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an \"agreement\"? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by \\'Marshallese\\' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in \\'cyberspace\\') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site.

According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of \"the kingdom of EnenKio,\" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands.\" \\nhttp://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: \"Fantasy Island\", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the \"Melchizedek press release\" you cited, indicating that \"...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of \"the kingdom of EnenKio,...\". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. \\nThe Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore\\'s rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is \"...another only-in- cyberspace country...\", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by \\'Marshallese\\' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries.

While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with \"**\") in color: \\n**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** \\nCorrection: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the \\nnorthernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: \"Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory.\" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan\\'s historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. \\nThe Author responds: \"I don\\'t see much conflict between the two versions here.\" \\n**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: \"I will note this.\" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai\\'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai\\'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho\\'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island\\'s independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. \\nThe Author responds: \"I will make the necessary corrections here.\" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** \\nCorrection: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios \\nsucceeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. \\nThe Author responds: \"I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore\\'s Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent.

The author, \"Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary\", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said \"press release\" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called \"Press Release\": \\nThis unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false.

The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more \"remote\" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice.\" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. \\nThe unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least.

Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind.

SKIP TO NEXT FILE \\xa0TOP OF PAGE \\nMarch 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A \"State of War\" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.Â\\xa0 The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in \"taking possession\" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.Â\\xa0 The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.Â\\xa0 Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.Â\\xa0 Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the \"\\'State of War\\', a Declaration\" and broadcast it to the world.Â\\xa0 The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.Â\\xa0 It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.Â\\xa0 While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.Â\\xa0 The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.Â\\xa0 Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.Â\\xa0 The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. \\nWhile the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.Â\\xa0 The refusal of \\nthe U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.Â\\xa0 Your understanding is appreciated.Â\\xa0 \\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \\xa0TOP OF PAGE\\nDecember 19, 1998: News Release \\nSubject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio \\nThe government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions.

News Article \\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \\xa0TOP OF PAGE \\nJuly 14, 1998: CommuniquÃ© to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against \"fraudulent claims\". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual \"state of war\" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. \\nThe Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) \"asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries...\" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People\\'s venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d\\'Ãªtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to \\nthe Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org \\nReferencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled \"Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,\" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom\\'s web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. \\nThe published statement, \"The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain...\", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not \"created\" by Robert Moore and he is not a \"Honolulu-based attorney.\" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. \"Enenkio\" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. \"Wake\" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers. \\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \\xa0TOP OF PAGE\\nMay 4, 1997: News Release \\nSubject: Issuance of Gold Stamps \\nThe government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps.

However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in \"exile\". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. \\nA NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to \"Wake\" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. \\n\"STATE OF WAR\" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual \"state of war\" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. \\nCLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the \"state of war\" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace. \\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE \\xa0TOP OF PAGE\\nMarch 31, 1997: News Release \\nAn official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: \"A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. \\nThis latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. \\nThe land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by \"Western explorers\" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. \\nHowever, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its \"ownership\" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the \"natives\" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more \"hospitable\" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho\\'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. \\nUpon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, \"yields to the recognition that a State of War\" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. \"ownership\" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: Â» Â» \"...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable \\naccord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR...\". Â» Â» \"If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens.\" \\nÂ» Â» \"...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and\\nevery \\naction of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone...\" \\nÂ» Â» \"...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior Â» Â» \"...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay.\" Â» Â» That the \"...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process...\". \\nThe government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE \\xa0TOP OF PAGE \\nFebruary 6, 1995: News Release \\nOn behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year\\'s Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; \\n2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the \"star wars\" program, I am led to believe. \\nAn emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army\\'s so-called \"no significant impact\" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. \\nOn March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. \\nDocuments and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. \\nRequest for Media Response: \\nThe thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of \"world leadership\"? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: \\n1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) \\n2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was \"decommissioned\" after the so-called \"processing\" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). \\n3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. \\n4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king\\'s claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. \\n5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) \\n6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho\\'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) \\nParting Shot: \\nWhat truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western \"civilized\" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of \"manifest destiny\" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at \"fixing up the world\". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. \\nTOP OF PAGE\\nNovember 21, 1994: News Release \\nIn a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. \\nThe legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios\\' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. \\nWhile putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. \\nEneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King\\'s behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King\\'s assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: \"Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island\" and stated: \"Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control\". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. \\nSince 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: Â» Â» Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was \"decommissioned\" more than a decade ago. \\nÂ» Â» In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed \\nTheater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. Â» Â» Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. Â» Â» A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since \"formal\" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese \"natural\" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. \\nStill mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military 1 808 923-0476 fax/phone \\nRobert Moore, Minister Plenipotentiary, Kingdom of EnenKio Foreign Trade Mission \\nDO-MO-CO Manager, Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust, Majuro, Marshall Islands \\nhttp://www.enenkio.org \\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"Hi All,\\n\\nI have a question which is a bit tricky and was\\nwondering of anyone has come across this problem\\nbefore or could point me in the right direction.\\n\\nI am involved in porting a SCO unix application to\\nLinux, and we have encountered a problem with the way\\nsemaphores  are being handled. The application uses\\nmulitple processes to run application code with the\\nmain process known as the bsh which controls all i/o\\nbe it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled\\nvia semaphores.\\n\\nIn certain circumstances the main process and the\\napplication child process seem to lock up both waiting\\nfor the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I\\nhave attached ddd to the processes and it seems that\\nthe semaphore code is doing the correct things for\\nsyncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the\\nsemop() system call.\\n\\nI have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay\\nbetween changing semaphore states the problem goes\\naway, but this causes our entire application to run\\nreally sloooww !! lol\\n\\nIs there anything weird or different with the standard\\nimplemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could\\ncause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state\\n\\nin a semaphore immediately?\\n\\nSetting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==\\nEAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails\\n(-1) also fixes the problem but again system\\nperformance goes down the toilet.\\n\\nboth the parent controlling process run as the same\\nuid, and the parent creates the semaphores with\\npermissions 0666.\\n\\nAny pointers would be appreciated!\\n\\nRgds,\\n\\nColin Nevin \\n\\n__________________________________________________\\nDo You Yahoo!?\\nEverything you'll ever need on one web page\\nfrom News and Sport to Email and Music Charts\\nhttp://uk.my.yahoo.com\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Just anti-liberal?  \\n\\nBetter question: What if, as in physics, the laws of human behaviour\\nare the same everywhere in the Universe?  What if Al Queda is in fact\\nmore like our mafia or biker gangs or school board trustees? \\n\\nWhat if they operate by the same neural-annealing Maxima-Minima\\ngratification mechanisms as you or I and every other creature on this\\nplanet?  \\n\\nWhat if, instead of magically and uniquely alien, they are, just like\\nour own captains and leaders, really only in it for the money, for\\ntrade rights-of-way and for power over minions who will foolishly make\\nit all happen, minions whom they can once again dup with /virtually/\\n/identical/ rhetoric ... except we call theirs \"fundamentalist islam\",\\nand they call ours \"imperialist satanism\"?\\n\\nWhen both sides can call the other \"evil\" to the cheers of their local\\npublic and media, you can bet something\\'s rotten in the state of Denmark.\\n\\nI guess that\\'s why I live in the woods.

Some recent research points worth mentioning:\\n\\nRecent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and\\ntemperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest\\ncorrelation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\\nare not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\\nincrease in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\\npreceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\\nof the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\\ncorrelated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\\ncausative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a\\nfairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an\\nauthoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.\\n\\nWith respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\\npoint out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\\nregular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle\\npeaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this\\ncycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete\\ncyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and\\ntime), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it\\nhappens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\\ncyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other\\nwords, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we\\nwould be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\\nrecord.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\\nconcentrations.\\n\\nAlso, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\\naffects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\\npredictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\\nfeedback systems mentioned above.\\n\\nLast, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it\\nmakes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and\\nmethane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule\\nbasis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something\\nthat CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the\\nbiosphere.\\n\\nCO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\\nstudies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\\npassenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't\\nthink it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in\\nunderstanding warming trends.\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

This is particularly true since so much\\nof our military is made up of reserve components these days, meaning\\nthat you can't move the soldiers to where the training facilities are.\\n\\nThe second is environmental lawsuits and pending judicial action and\\ninjunctions. The desert training facilities in the Southwest deserts\\nhave been aggressively assaulted by environmental organizations who are\\nmaking the case that heavy mechanized units zipping back and forth\\nacross the deep desert endanger the desert tortoise and a bunch of other\\ntheoretically endangered species that are concentrated in the southwest\\ndeserts. The ability of the military to use the desert facilities has\\nbeen significantly impeded these days while all the lawsuits and whatnot\\nwith the various environmental groups are being sorted out.\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com\\n\\n\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with\\ncurrent events surrounding the companies you hold.\\n\\nNotice that we didn\\'t spend much (meaning any) time discussing\\nWall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one\\nreason: We don\\'t care what analysts think, and we certainly\\ndon\\'t put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.\\n\\nSure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have\\nsignificantly more access to business management than we ever\\nwill as individual investors, so they can have some valuable\\ninsights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of\\ncompany trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond\\nmarket (more on this later). \"Strong buy?\" Pfffffft.\\n\\nIn this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is\\nslipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly\\nvalued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large\\nshare price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple\\nof 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is\\npriced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple\\ncompany are much more likely to be traumatized if its business\\nstarts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows,\\nwhatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular,\\nit\\'s important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a\\ncompany that\\'s growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.\\n\\nSo let\\'s look at a few instances where companies have started to\\ngo wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning\\nsigns of an impending stock collapse before it happens.\\n\\nWARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH\\nThrough 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of\\nthe fastest-growing stocks in the \\'90s and the largest, best\\ncapitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the\\nmarket: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted\\nrevenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April\\n2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the\\nnext quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E)\\ncompany, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in\\na row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a\\nbarnburner like Nokia, one is enough.\\n\\nSome words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest\\nsectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they\\nalways do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then\\ncanals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If\\nyou\\'re expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and\\nthey don\\'t, it\\'s time to position your finger on the sell\\ntrigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give\\na company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on\\nthe second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a\\nyear-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a\\nyear-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly\\ngrowth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew\\nsequential growth.)\\n\\nWARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH\\nBy April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs\\nwere surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies\\ngrowing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom\\nlines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia\\'s sales\\nwere growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end\\nof the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70%\\nto 40%.\\n\\nProfits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to\\ncollapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics\\nchanged quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock\\nreacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the\\ntechnology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see\\nsigns that something was wrong.\\n\\nWARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS\\nIn 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings\\nperspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look\\nat two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free\\ncash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have\\nsignificant capital investment demands, but low operating cash\\nflow is inexcusable. Lucent\\'s experiences are telling. In 1999,\\nLucent\\'s full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion,\\nbased upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the\\nworld, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications\\nequipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.\\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057\\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058\\n\\nBut as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were\\nafoot, lurking in the company\\'s cash flow statement. On an\\noperating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost\\n$276 million. That\\'s a far cry from the $4.7 billion in\\nreported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than\\n$2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference\\nbetween Lucent\\'s earnings and its free cash flow (operating\\ncash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3\\nbillion, and not in a good way.\\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059\\n\\nThe investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have\\nsaved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999,\\nLucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but\\ntwice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow\\nis reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)\\n\\nAnd get this -- you\\'ll see nearly the exact same thing on\\nEnron\\'s old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they\\nweren\\'t generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.\\n\\nWARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS\\nRemember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it\\'s\\nbecause their information can be quite conflicted, and it\\'s\\nalmost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best\\ninterests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the\\nsame type of signals: investors who hold a company\\'s bonds.\\n\\nBondholders buy a piece of a company\\'s debt and are generally\\npaid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the\\ncurrent price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds\\nbondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I\\nrecommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of\\nthe bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders\\nare growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same\\ntime analysts are shouting, \"Strong buy!\"\\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690060\\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690061\\n\\nI recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company\\nand get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity\\nbetween five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced\\nat 100 is at \"par,\" which means that the bond\\'s face-value\\ninterest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some\\nbonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be\\nlower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk.\\nBut some are priced below face value, even way below.\\nhttp://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062\\n\\nAs of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at\\n18, which means that bondholders assume there\\'s little chance\\nthey\\'ll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent\\nproblems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with\\n2011 maturity priced at 83. That\\'s a discount to face, but not\\none that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports\\na price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than\\nTyco. These prices don\\'t indicate healthy companies, but they\\ndon\\'t insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.\\n\\nWARNING SIGN 5: \"IT JUST DOESN\\'T GET ANY BETTER\"\\nFor a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the\\nlargest company in the world by market capitalization. This\\nshould have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the\\nstock was around $57, Cisco\\'s valuation of nearly $400 billion\\nimplied that investors expected the company\\'s earnings to reach\\n$34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings\\nhigher than $12 billion in a single year.\\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063\\n\\nAs it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco --\\nit has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that\\narticle. Only those that decided it couldn\\'t possibly get any\\nbetter achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no\\nsigns of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000,\\nCisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8\\nbillion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of\\n53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then\\n66% higher.\\n\\nOnly Cisco\\'s stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine\\na $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for\\nfuture growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the\\nmidst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As\\ninvestors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities.\\nTaking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this\\npoint, would\\'ve been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco\\'s business\\nwas fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot\\nhas to be right for the situation to work out.\\n\\nHOMEWORK\\nFor this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after\\nLesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you\\nlooked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company,\\ndo the following:\\n\\n- Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four\\n  quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,\\n  staying about the same, or weakening?\\n\\n- Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past\\n  four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing\\n  slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?\\n\\n- Track your company\\'s operating cash flow for each of the past\\n  three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net\\n  income for the corresponding year? (We\\'re not having you look\\n  at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around\\n  due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much\\n  more indicative of real cash flow trends.)\\n\\n- If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center\\n  and check the price of your company\\'s bonds. (If you don\\'t know\\n  whether your company has any debt, just type your company name\\n  into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)\\n  http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064\\n\\n- Finally, examine your company\\'s market cap relative to its\\n  current net income over the past year. What\\'s the P/E ratio? Is\\n  there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario\\n  already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,\\n  this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it\\'s\\n  still a question you should consider.)\\n\\nTo help you out, we\\'ve put together the Foolish Stock Information\\nForm to track all of your research and information about your\\nstocks.

There\\'s a far better example: The New York Times.  \\n\\nIncredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality \\nprofessional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in \\ntrucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to \\npeople. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an \\ninsidious peer-to-peer downloading system called \"the Web\" by typing in the \\nkeyword \"www.nytimes.com\". Those people at the New York Times must not \\nunderstand the Internet or something! \\n\\nMore examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian \\nand others. \\n\\nOther times, people claim that no one will create if they can\\'t get paid.

Any ideas ?\\n\\nAlso, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.\\nIf they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),\\nfalse positives become the senders problem, to rewrite\\nto remove the spam smell.\\n\\nIn a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much\\nsmaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be\\nslightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from\\nthe ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.\\n\\nHaving a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,\\nthere's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,\\nand we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,\\nthat didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.\\n\\nIt might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from\\nthe spam corpus, in case of user ooops.\\n\\n\\t/Paul\\n\\n\",\n",

A number of new standards\\nand commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing\\nWeb-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the\\nrange and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.\\n\\nThe goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web\\ndesign, software engineering, and information technology communities to\\ndiscuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and\\ntool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.\\nExpertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and\\nexperience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing\\nplatforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and\\nInternet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation\\nof form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the\\nWeb.\\n\\nWSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related\\nto exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not\\nlimited to):\\n\\n*   Migrating to Web services\\n*   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product\\ncontrol\\n*   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable\\n*   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure\\n*   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple\\nplatforms\\n*   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as\\narchitecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites\\n*   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolution\\n\\nWSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software\\nMaintenance (ICSM 2002).

       " '\"In fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of\\nstartups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as\\nit did in the boom year of 1999.\"  Oookaaaay...\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_eeTimes_05-08-02.shtml\\n\\nIconoclast designers choose MIPS\\nBy Anthony Cataldo\\nMay 28, 2002  \\n\\nSAN JOSE, Calif. -- A group of engineers in Calabasas Hills, CA wants to\\nturn the microprocessor world on its head by doing the unthinkable:\\ntossing out the clock and letting the signals move about unencumbered.\\nFor those designers, inspired by research conducted at nearby Caltech,\\nclocks are for wimps.\\n\\nThe Fulcrum Microsystems Inc. design team isn\\'t the first to propose an\\nasynchronous processor, but president and chief executive officer Robert\\nNunn wants to be the first to take a clockless, fire-breathing processor\\nmainstream. \"We really deal with an asynchronous world,\" he said. \"We\\nonly make it synchronous for our own convenience.\"\\n\\nThis is the kind of stuff that many in the processor industry would\\nconsider lunatic fringe, too weird for conservative embedded-systems\\ndesigners. But the young processor company and more than a dozen others\\nlike it are anchored in the mainstream courtesy of the MIPS\\ninstruction-set architecture. More and more, MIPS is becoming the choice\\nfor maverick processor design teams seeking a place at the high end by\\nfielding unorthodox devices. And if Motorola and IBM in the PowerPC camp\\naren\\'t careful, they could see their performance leadership in the\\nhigh-end embedded-processor market snatched away by some of these upstarts.\\n\\nIn Austin, Texas, meanwhile, designers at another MIPS house, Intrinsity\\nInc., aren\\'t prepared to ditch the clock. But they are putting a new\\nspin on some old tricks such as giving each gate its own clock and then\\nletting them overlap. Using such sleight of hand, the company hopes to\\nsoon deliver RISC-based processors that run at an eye-popping 2 GHz and\\nconsume just 10 to 15 watts.\\n\\nFulcrum, Intrinsity and their brethren may once have been written off as\\ninteresting experiments, backed by venture capitalists who overlooked\\nsome of the finer details, like software compatibility. What lends them\\nrespectability is MIPS.\\n\\nTheirs for the asking \\n\\nOne reason young processor companies seem to be flocking to the platform\\nis that its steward, MIPS Technologies Inc., has no qualms about\\nlicensing the instruction-set architecture (ISA), provided that the\\nlicensee agrees to meet a software-compatibility test suite. By\\ncontrast, processor-core rival ARM Ltd. has granted this privilege to\\njust two of its many licensees, Intel and Motorola. And so far, the two\\nPowerPC vendors, IBM Corp. and Motorola Inc., have rebuffed most\\nrequests to license that architecture, with the notable exception being\\nFPGA vendor Xilinx Inc., which has licensed the 405 PowerPC from IBM.\\n\\nThe MIPS ISA is also one of the simplest forms of\\nreduced-instruction-set computing around, which tends to make it\\nattractive to processor designers interested in extending the\\narchitecture. It was this and the wide availability of tools and\\nsoftware that drew Intrinsity to MIPS, even though the company is aiming\\nat PowerPC sockets, as evidenced by its decision to adopt the RapidIO\\ninterface instead of HyperTransport, which has been favored by MIPS vendors.\\n\\nGood fit \\n\\n\"It\\'s a nice, clean architecture and has an open model that allows us to\\nadd instructions,\" said Paul Nixon, chief executive officer of\\nIntrinsity.  \"You also get all the third-party tools that very easily\\nfit into our base of platforms.\"\\n\\nThere was a time when this openness was seen as a liability for MIPS. In\\nthe mid-1990s, before MIPS was spun out from Silicon Graphics Inc., the\\ninstruction set lacked a multiply-add instruction, so some MIPS vendors\\ntook it upon themselves to create their own. The problem was that this\\nbroke many of the development tools, causing headaches for compiler\\nvendors like Green Hills Software Inc.\\n\\n\"We went to MIPS and said we have 20 different compiler variants and\\nit\\'s embarrassing,\" said Craig Franklin, vice president of engineering\\nat Green Hills and a respected microprocessor industry veteran. Franklin\\nalso wasn\\'t shy about telling MIPS it needed to revamp its embedded\\napplication binary interface. \"We went to MIPS and said we\\'ve done a\\ndozen EABIs, let\\'s clean up yours,\" he said.\\n\\nMIPS took the advice and wasted little time clamping down on\\narchitectural deviations, observers said. But the MIPS camp still has to\\nlive with a legacy of incompatible chips in the field. \"To its credit,\\nMIPS quickly caught on,\" said Jim Turley, a microprocessor industry\\nanalyst. \"Going forward, MIPS is maintaining good control but they are\\nstill haunted by incompatibility among multiples.\"\\n\\nIf the biggest risk to the MIPS camp is fragmentation, then the PowerPC\\ncamp has the opposite problem: architectural confinement. Though the\\nPowerPC architecture carries the cachet of household names Motorola and\\nIBM, these are essentially the only two companies that provide\\nPowerPCs. It\\'s not for lack of interest. Rather, the companies have been\\nreluctant to cede control over the architecture. This could wind up\\nhurting the PowerPC cause, though.\\n\\n\"To get a PowerPC license is impossible or very expensive,\" Green Hills\\'\\nFranklin said. \"Tactically this may have been a mistake. If you\\'re a\\nJapanese company, all things being equal, you\\'d rather buy from another\\nJapanese company.\"\\n\\nAnalyst Turley, too, thinks the PowerPC camp will only stand to gain by\\nlicensing the architecture. \"It\\'s all about software compatibility and\\ntool support. The more you can proliferate the architecture the better\\nyou\\'re going to do,\" he said. \"I don\\'t think Motorola and IBM can\\naddress the entire market by themselves.\"\\n\\nThere\\'s a chance that this could change. IBM, for its part, is in the\\nprocess of planning an expansion strategy for PowerPC that may involve\\nmore licensing. Though it\\'s unlikely the PowerPC camp will ever have the\\nopen licensing model of MIPS Technologies, MIPS processor vendors may\\nhave more than just two competitors to worry about.\\n\\n\"We\\'re certainly not averse to [licensing],\" said Lisa Su, director of\\nPowerPC products at IBM. \"The question is, how much do we do and who do\\nwe license to. There are various ways you could go, whether it\\'s a hard\\ncore, soft core or licensing the ISA.\"\\n\\nBut the fear of architectural fragmentation still looms large. \"We know\\nthat if we have different microarchitectures we have to do work on\\nsoftware compatibility,\" Su said. \"With MIPS there\\'s a degree of\\nfracturing. That may not always be a big problem, but if you go to other\\nmarkets -- like consumer -- it becomes big. Our belief is there is a\\nhappy medium.\"\\n\\nWhatever path IBM takes it will act in its own best interest as a chip\\nprovider, not as a company that wants to hawk intellectual\\nproperty. This is why the Xilinx licensing deal works for IBM: Big Blue\\nis not so much interested in the royalties and fees it collects from\\nXilinx, but in the dual benefit of widening the appeal of the\\narchitecture and the revenue IBM generates from manufacturing the FPGAs\\nfor Xilinx in its own fabs. \"We\\'re not trying to make money off of\\nlicensing,\" Su said.\\n\\nManufacturing is probably one of the most powerful weapons that PowerPC\\nvendors IBM and Motorola wield. Both have gussied up their high-end\\nlines with copper interconnect and silicon-on-insulator technology,\\nstill rarities among chip makers. This has helped both companies design\\nrelatively low-power embedded processors running at 1 GHz that are\\nshipping today. IBM did it using 0.13-micron design rules and a\\nfour-stage pipeline; Motorola is using 0.18-micron design rules and a\\nseven-stage pipe.\\n\\nThe companies say there\\'s more performance headroom in store. \"When we\\nget to 0.13 micron we\\'ll get substantially faster,\" said Raj Handa,\\nPowerPC and PowerQuicc marketing manager at Motorola.\\n\\nProprietary processes \\n\\nMost MIPS processor vendors, by contrast, rely on mainstream foundries\\nthat haven\\'t developed the more-exotic process technologies. And even\\nthough companies like Motorola are shifting more capacity to outside\\nfoundries, they\\'re keeping their special process recipes in-house to\\njuice up their high-performance devices.\\n\\nLacking this capability, most MIPS processor vendors will have little\\nchoice but to come up with dazzling architectural feats to keep up their\\nchops at the high end. It should become clear in the next year or so how\\nsome of the newer players measure up.\\n\\nIntrinsity hopes to field its 2-GHz processors by the end of the\\nyear. Fulcrum is shooting for an early 2003 introduction. \"We\\'re going\\nto shock the industry in terms of raw performance and speed-vs.-power\\nperformance,\" Fulcrum\\'s Nunn said. \"We really want to change the way the\\nworld designs semiconductors.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.fulcrummicro.com/press/article_fastco_04-02.shtml\\n\\nThe Pasadena startup machine\\nBy Alison Overholt\\nApril, 2002  \\n\\nThere was a time when every dorm room, it seemed, was a startup waiting\\nto happen. Throughout the 1990s, kids cobbled together business plans\\nbetween classes, won funding, and jumped into business. Risk? What risk?\\nPlunging into a new venture seemed all too easy.\\n\\nAh, the fickleness of youth. These days, most of the kids are back in\\nclass. Venture capitalists say that they\\'re seeing precious few\\nproposals out of MIT, Stanford, and almost every other university, save\\none: the California Institute of Technology.\\n\\nIn fact, Caltech says that it actually spun out the same number of\\nstartups in 2001 -- a poor time, needless to say, for new ventures -- as\\nit did in the boom year of 1999. While startup enthusiasm has faded on\\nmost campuses, Caltech has blossomed into a robust new-company machine.\\n\\nThis didn\\'t happen by accident. During the past seven years, Caltech\\'s\\nOffice of Technology Transfer has carefully developed a strategy for\\ncultivating commerce. \"We focus on nurturing entrepreneurs\\nscientifically more than other schools do,\" says Rich Wolfe, the\\noffice\\'s associate director. That is, the university focuses more on the\\nscience itself than on the ensuing commercial opportunity.\\n\\nThat\\'s what grabbed Uri Cummings and Andrew Lines, two PhD students at\\nCaltech who founded Fulcrum Microsystems in 2000. \"There is a pervasive\\nphilosophy at Caltech that no problem is unsolvable,\" Cummings\\nsays. \"There\\'s a focus on scientific ingenuity that is thrilling to be\\naround. Caltech has so many entrepreneurs because the school doesn\\'t\\nmake it about business or focus on how much money they\\'ll get out of\\nit. Caltech is a catalyst, moving technology from the university out\\ninto industry, and students are thrilled to be a part of it.\"\\n\\nBefore starting Fulcrum, Cummings and Lines worked for six years with\\nCaltech computer-science professor Alain Martin on an\\nasynchronous-circuit design for semiconductor chips. They ventured into\\ncommercialization while still in the throes of their doctoral program.\\n\\nThat they could afford to do that points to another, more practical\\naspect to Caltech\\'s approach. Other universities typically require\\nentrepreneurs to pay up-front application and licensing fees for the use\\nof technology patents. But Caltech believes that such payments stifle\\nentrepreneurship, since young companies usually have little cash to\\nspare. Instead, the school typically takes equity stakes in startups,\\nand it defers collection of patent payments until fledgling companies\\nare financially secure.\\n\\nFor Caltech, it\\'s a long-term bet. \"The reality is that universities\\nrely far more on their endowments than they could on any fees to be\\ncollected from the initial licensing process,\" Wolfe says. \"So we seek a\\nbite of the apple -- and we hope that if one of these entrepreneurs\\nfounds the next Intel, he\\'ll not only share the equity but also bestow a\\ngift on the university in remembrance that we took care of him when he\\nwas just getting started.\"\\n\\nCummings and Lines may be in a position to do just that. Fulcrum has won\\nabout $20 million in venture funding amid the toughest venture market in\\nrecent history. Its founders have hired a credible CEO, Bob Nunn, who\\nformerly ran Vitesse\\'s telecom division, and hired 24 top students from\\ntheir alma mater. And they\\'ve garnered rave reviews of their chip design\\nfrom technology journals.\\n\\nOne thing that Cummings and Lines haven\\'t done yet: finished their\\ndegrees. Officially, both are now \"on leave.\" They may not be back.\\n\\n\\n\\n----\\naDaM@XeNT.CoM\\n\\n\\nHigh-tech startups fail for only three reasons: stupidity, luck, and greed. \\n\\nTip one for would-be entrepreneurs: Avoid stupid and unlucky people. If\\nyou are stupid or have bad luck, don\\'t start a high-tech business.\\n\\nTip two for would-be entrepreneurs: Do a product that you want to do,\\nnot one that they want you to do.\\n\\nStartup founders generally have only ideas, charisma, and equity to work\\nwith. Ideas and charisma are cheap, but equity is expensive.  To make a\\nstart-up work, the founder has to divvy out parts of the business at\\njust the right rate to keep everyone happy until the product is a\\nsuccess. Give away too much of your company too soon to a venture\\ncapitalist, to your co-workers, or even to yourself, and you risk\\nrunning out of distributable shares before the product is done. And that\\nprobably means the product won\\'t be done. Ever.\\n\\nTip three for would-be entrepreneurs: Don\\'t take venture funding too soon. \\n\\nIf you are doing a software product, don\\'t take venture money until you\\nneed it to introduce the product.  Don\\'t take venture money until you\\nhave used up all of your own money, your mother-in-law\\'s money, and\\neverything you can borrow.\\n\\nBootstrap. Rent, don\\'t buy. Don\\'t hire people to do things you can\\ncontract out because contractors don\\'t require stock options.\\n\\nAs the founder, the man or woman with the grand plan, your function is\\nto manage the distribution of your own holdings so that you end up with\\nfewer shares but more wealth.\\n\\nTip four for would-be entrepreneurs: Invite me to lunch.

I am moved to write you this letter. \\n\\nThis was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. \\n\\nHence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation\\ntill when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over\\n(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State\\nDollars (US$18,000,000,00.)

Hettinga\" <rah@shipwright.com>\\nSubject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation\\nSender: <dbs@philodox.com>\\n\\nhttp://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp\\n\\nPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002\\n\\n\\nDan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation\\n\\nBy Dan Gillmor\\nMercury News Technology Columnist\\n\\nThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy\\nindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify\\nsoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.\\n\\nNow, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial\\nand fiscal mess we\\'ll be cleaning up for decades, we\\'re learning what\\neveryone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.\\n\\nThe latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday\\'s finding by a federal\\nadministrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed\\nsupplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after\\nCalifornia\\'s Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity\\ngenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,\\nalso driving up prices.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked\\nthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider\\'s boast in a\\nmemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to\\nrelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any\\ncongestion.\\'\\'\\n\\nHow much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be\\nseen. Unfortunately, California\\'s response -- confusion, lawsuits and\\npolicy tweaks -- hasn\\'t been sufficient.\\n\\nMore unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --\\nincluding a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers\\'\\ngrips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it\\'s foolish to think\\nthat the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least\\nfavorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of\\ntraditional, non-renewable energy sources.\\n\\nIf the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any\\nfruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the\\nstate amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That\\'s a\\nreasonable approach, but don\\'t expect miracles.\\n\\nState policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.\\nInstead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if\\nit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the\\nutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,\\'\\'\\nnotes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for\\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).\\n\\nIt\\'s tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --\\ntempting but a bad idea. When there\\'s genuine competition, as we could\\nachieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better\\njob. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to\\ninject real competition into the market.\\n\\nWe do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity\\ndefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation\\nis essential.\\n\\nBut the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers\\ncontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of\\nboth.\\n\\nThe best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up\\nthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California\\'s utilities\\nwill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable\\nsources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.\\n\\nBut this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer\\nmodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer\\nideas isn\\'t enough.\\n\\nThe state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small\\ngenerators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,\\nharder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is\\ncoming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.\\n\\nInvesting to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.\\nCalifornia should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax\\nincentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn\\'t\\ndone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did\\nreact to last year\\'s soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it\\'s\\nlunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it\\naltogether.\\n\\nMaybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration\\'s energy policies, so\\ngrossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are\\nmaking us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming\\nwar in Iraq goes badly.\\n\\nIt\\'s pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to\\ndrastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy\\nsystem. But the largest state, one of the world\\'s major economies in its\\nown right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it\\nhurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next\\nyear.\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR. A.

Companies that have taken on way too much debt can\\nscrew their shareholders and even some of their debt-holders by\\ndeclaring bankruptcy, as Enron and Worldcom have done; meanwhile,\\nit becomes more difficult for individuals who have similarly taken on\\ntoo much debt, to dig their way out of their own holes...\\n\\nIn my next life, I\\'m coming back as a corporation.  They get all the\\nperks. :)\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/27/business/27BANK.html\\n\\nA Sudden Rush to Declare Bankruptcy Is Expected\\nBy PHILIP SHENON\\n\\nWASHINGTON, July 26 The compromise bill, which was approved on Thursday\\nby Congressional negotiators and is expected to be adopted in both the\\nHouse and Senate by the end of next week, will make it much harder for\\nAmericans to wipe out their debts when they declare bankruptcy.\\n\\nAfter the agreement, lawyers around the country said that they had begun\\nto receive calls and visits from debtors worried that they needed to\\nfile bankruptcy before the old rules lapse next year.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had plenty of calls this morning,\" said Gary F. Weltmann, a\\nconsumer bankruptcy lawyer in Washington. \"And I\\'m telling people that\\nthey need to take action now.\"\\n\\nMarty K. Courson, a bankruptcy lawyer in San Francisco, said he was\\n\"getting ready for the onslaught.\"\\n\\n\"I do think there will be a lot of people trying to use the old rules,\"\\nhe said.\\n\\nThe White House announced today that President Bush would sign the bill,\\nwhich was scheduled for a final vote in the House late tonight and in\\nthe Senate next week. \\n\\n\"The president looks forward to signing that,\" said Ari Fleischer, the\\nWhite House spokesman. \"That bill enjoys widespread bipartisan support\\nfor good reasons.\" \\n\\nThe bill, which had been stalled until this week in a House-Senate\\nconference committee, passed both chambers by overwhelming margins more\\nthan a year ago. The conference committee approved the bill Thursday\\nafter agreeing on an abortion-rights provision that had been the final\\nobstacle to passage; the provision will bar anti-abortion protesters\\nfrom using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying court judgments as a\\nresult of clinic protests.\\n\\nThe bill has long been the top legislative priority of the credit card\\nand banking industries, which say that many people now abuse the\\nbankruptcy system by writing off debts that they should be able to\\npay. There were 1.45 million bankruptcy filings last year, a record, up\\n19 percent from 2000.\\n\\n\"This legislation restores integrity and accountability to our\\nbankruptcy system by offering a fresh start to those who deserve one\\nwhile cracking down on those who don\\'t,\" said Representative F. James\\nSensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House\\nJudiciary Committee.\\n\\nCritics, including top consumer-rights groups, described the bill as a\\ngift to lenders in exchange for a recent, drastic increase in campaign\\ncontributions to members of Congress. They also said that it would do\\nharm to millions of Americans in financial distress as a result of lost\\njobs, poor health or divorce.\\n\\nThe bill\\'s opponents have also questioned the timing of its passage,\\nwhich comes in the midst of a Congressional crackdown on abusive\\naccounting practices by many of the largest companies, including some of\\nthe same financial services companies that have lobbied strenuously for\\nthe bankruptcy bill.\\n\\n\"The timing couldn\\'t be worse,\" said Travis B. Plunkett, the legislative\\ndirector of the Consumer Federation of America. \"It takes a lot of gall\\nfor Congress to make a move like this when so many Americans are\\nconcerned about corporate abuses, and when the economy is so shaky.\" \\n\\nSenator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who is a leading critic of\\nthe bill, said today that \"it boggles the mind that at a time when\\nAmericans are more economically vulnerable, when they are most in need\\nof protection from financial disaster, we would eviscerate the major\\nfinancial safety net in our society for the middle class.\"\\n\\nBankruptcy lawyers said that the bill would do harm to low- and\\nmiddle-income clients who would be saddled with debts that would take\\nthem years to pay back. The new law will end the debt-free \"fresh start\"\\nthat many of those debtors had been permitted under the current law.\\n\\nRecent studies have shown that the average American filing for\\nbankruptcy has a median household income well below the national average\\nof about $42,000 in 2000. A study cited in Congressional testimony last\\nyear showed that the average person filing for bankruptcy had a car that\\nwas six to nine years old, and that a quarter of those people had\\nmedical debts exceeding $1,000.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t deny that there are people who abuse the bankruptcy system,\"\\nsaid Mr. Weltmann, the Washington lawyer whose firm calls itself the\\nBankruptcy Center. \"But there are honest, hard-working folks who are\\nreally going to be affected by these changes.\"\\n\\nThe bill would impose a means test on debtors, based on median incomes\\nin their home states, for bankruptcy filings under Charter 7 of the\\nfederal bankruptcy law, which permits debtors to erase most of their\\nunsecured debts, like credit card bills.\\n\\nDebtors with an income above the state median would be barred from\\nfiling under Chapter 7 and would instead be required to file instead\\nunder Chapter 13, which requires that a portion of the unsecured debt be\\nrepaid over time under the court-administered plan.\\n\\nMr. Courson, the San Francisco lawyer, said that the changes would \"hurt\\na lot of consumer debtors who really, rightfully belong in Chapter 7.\"\\n\\n\"My clients, for the most part, are honest and unfortunate people, and\\nthey\\'ve just got heavy debt,\" he said. \"You can always find some\\ncircumstance where a person really went to town with a credit card and\\ngot themselves in trouble. But I have people who are just plain old\\npoor. My experience is something wildly different than the story that\\nthe credit card companies make to Congress.\"\\n\\n\\n----\\naDaM@XeNT.CoM -- .sig double play!\\n\\n\\nAt its peak, there were more than 100 peer-to-peer start-ups. There now\\nremain, at most, a couple of dozen companies concentrated in a few\\nniches. The main activity of companies venturing into peer to peer is\\nfile sharing. But the dozens of overoptimistic forays into alternative\\neconomic systems, hyper-sophisticated technologies, and recording\\nindustry collaboration turned out to be dead ends.  Peer-to-peer\\nauctions, peer-to-peer supply chain management, and peer-to-peer e-mail\\nmay have failed because they were ahead of their time. It\\'s more likely\\nthey failed because they were just ahead of themselves.  Clearly, the\\npublic\\'s appetite for file sharing has increased, and the state of the\\nart has improved dramatically. But companies have still not yet found\\nsatisfactory business models, thus leaving file sharing\\'s last chapter\\nunwritten.\\n  -- Gene Kan, http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/zd/20020710/tc_zd/942734\\n\\n\\nXML proxies are add-ons to firewall and network environments that have\\nthe ability to monitor XML traffic and apply business rules and IT\\npolicies such as security, routing, performance, management,\\ntransformation, and connection provisioning.

Might save you serious\\nhassle down the line. \\n\\nOnly kidding but thats what I would do.\\n\\nCW\\n\\n----------------\\nOK, Here\\'s how to do it [1] ...\\n\\nWhile the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that\\'s broken,\\nbeg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and\\ninstall the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since\\nthey have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages\\nwill need to be reinstalled.  So:\\n\\n1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc\\n\\n\\tYour /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave\\n\\n2. rpm -ivh glibc-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm\\n3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel\\n4. rpm -ivh kernel-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm\\n\\nThis installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You\\'ll be able to boot\\nin a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At\\nleast those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will\\ncontain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you\\nneed to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to\\n/etc/ld.so.conf doesn\\'t seem to work):\\n\\n1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm\\n2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm\\n\\nfixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and\\nsane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.\\nReinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.\\n\\nThanks guys...\\n\\n> [snip]\\n> \\n> > > [I] wouldn\\'t bog it down with X either.\\n> >\\n> > That\\'s a thought but it may be useful for the server to be available as\\na\\n> > user machine also (maybe staff only, maybew admin only).

Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while\\nthe AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or\\nduron chips).  A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an\\ni586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.

I was shocked. What about Gettysburg \\nand the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? \\nJust look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His \\nclass had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big \\nbeefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, \\nthere was some of that. But the main difference between my son\\'s text \\nand that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous \\ndecision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American \\nhistory. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and \\nreciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping \\nfor easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation \\nof freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it \\nbecome possible to see the federal government\\'s main function as \\nresponding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, \\ninstead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic \\ninterests.\\n\\nEven now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty \\nspeeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you\\'d find \\nis thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so \\nmuch over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real \\nestate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which \\nthis competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and \\ncommissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It\\'s \\nan insider\\'s game, less because the players are secretive than because \\nthe public and the press\\x97encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon\\x97\\ncan\\'t get themselves interested.\\n\\nOne corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal \\nCommunications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand \\ndenizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate \\ncommerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that \\nthe commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription \\nprice: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they \\ngrumblingly attend the Chairman\\'s Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where \\nthe high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating \\ncomedy routine by the commission\\'s chairman.\\n\\nOf all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that \\nAmericans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with \\na business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the \\nAmerican economy, as well as important aspects of daily life\\x97telephone \\nand television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now \\nF.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, \\nbecause a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the \\n\"corporate scandals\" concerns the economic collapse of companies \\nregulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, \\namong others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is \\npart of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney \\nanalyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the \\nembodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the \\npast two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions \\nof dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a \\ndead weight pulling down the entire stock market.\\n\\nThis year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state \\nof the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes \\nF.C.C. World\\'s feverish mood (\"The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns\") \\nand suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of \\nthe commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I \\njust quoted is followed by this explanation: \"The ILECs appear likely to \\nenter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no \\nresidential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% \\nmarket share loss in business lines to CLECs.\" It\\'s a lot easier to \\nthink about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.\\n\\n\\nEven in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the \\ncommission\\'s chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially \\nintense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes \\nitself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael \\nPowell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, \\nbecause he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. \\nUnlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which \\ngenerates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about \\nwho he really is and what he\\'s really up to. Powell is young to be the \\nhead of a federal agency\\x97he is thirty-nine\\x97and genially charming. \\nEverybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years \\none of the F.C.C.\\'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the \\nF.C.C.\\'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the \\narcane details of communications policy. He\\'s always saying that he\\'s an \\n\"avid moderate.\" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his \\npredecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell \\nto Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, \\ncalls him \"radical and extreme.\" Just as often as he\\'s accused of being \\na right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically \\ncautious. \"It ain\\'t about singing \\'Kum-Ba-Yah\\' around the campfire,\" \\nanother former chairman, William Kennard, says. \"You have to have an \\nanswer.\" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate \\nsubcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the \\nsubcommittee\\'s chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated \\nhim. \"You don\\'t care about these regulations,\" Hollings said. \"You don\\'t \\ncare about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That\\'s the \\nfundamental. That\\'s the misgiving I have of your administration over \\nthere. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and \\nseem to not care at all. I think you\\'d be a wonderful executive \\nvice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a \\nregulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your \\njob?\"\\n\\n\"Extremely,\" Powell said, with an amiable smile.\\n\\n\\nOne cannot understand Powell\\'s maddening effect, at least on Democrats \\nand liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose \\nof the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was \\ncreated by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the \\nNew Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \\ncases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure \\nthat broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its \\nother original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, \\nthe national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers \\nunfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, \\nwell-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial \\nsupervision\\x97its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition \\namong communications companies so that it didn\\'t become too bloody, by \\nartfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. \\nIn addition to looking out for the public\\'s interest, the commission \\nmore specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many \\nof whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \\nterrifying category of interest group\\x97you can cross the local bank \\npresident and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. \\nAccording to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once \\nblocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \\nin the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the \\nanti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV \\nstation in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.\\n\\n\\nF.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, \\nbecause all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \\nniches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful \\nbreakup of A.T. & T.\\x97by far the biggest and most important company the \\ncommission regulated\\x97deposited a thick additional sediment of \\nself-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \\nago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \\nlong-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \\nwhich customers were not permitted to own\\x97and they were all the same \\ncompany. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \\nmid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \\nphone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \\nto offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \\neverywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers\\x97and \\nmillions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \\ntelephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a \"natural \\nmonopoly,\" requiring protection from economic competition and total \\ncontrol over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \\nthe F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \\nand the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \\nconsumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \\nprosperous, too.\\n\\nThe next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \\none of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \\nmost people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \\nAlthough the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \\nmodernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \\nbargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \\nas \"baby Bells\" and to F.C.C. World as \"arbocks\" (the pronounced version \\nof RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \\noffer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \\ncompanies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \\ncustomers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \\nget the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \\ncompetition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \\neconomics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \\nVice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \\nhelping to reposition them as the technology party\\x97the party that \\nbrought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \\njobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \\nbeneficiaries might become the party\\'s new contributor base. Clinton\\'s \\nslogans about the \"information superhighway\" and \"building a bridge to \\nthe twenty-first century,\" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \\nsent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \\ncorrelates of the Telecom Act, and Gore\\'s cruise to the Presidency was \\nsupposed to be powered substantially by the act\\'s success.\\n\\nThe F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \\naggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \\nall important interest groups they work with both parties); they \\nimmediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \\ncompetitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \\nrule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \\nReed Hundt, who was Gore\\'s classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \\nthe arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \\nlike A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \\ncompanies, \"see-lecks\" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \\nlocal exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \\nequivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \\naccess to the arbock\\'s switching equipment, the arbock won\\'t give the \\nseeleck a key to the room where it\\'s kept, so the see-leck asks the \\nF.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\\n\\nPartly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \\nhe would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \\ncondition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \\nsee-lecks\\x97companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent\\x97and \\ninto other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \\ntechnology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \\nboom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \\nand other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \\nof the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt\\'s \\nformer lieutenants told me, \"Reed used to joke that my job was to make \\nsure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.\"\\n\\n\\nThe years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \\nboom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \\nstartups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \\nTime Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and \\nComcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \\nbelieved that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative \\naccounting would go unnoticed because the market was so \\nundiscriminating.)\\n\\nBy the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \\ndetermined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the \\nchairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of \\ninfluence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. \\nThree Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; \\nHarold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and \\nPatrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as \\nsuch, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most \\npowerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of \\nS.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant \\nthat the arbocks didn\\'t want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he \\nmight be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \\nRegulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \\nwasn\\'t as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \\nmovement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \\nFurchtgott-Roth.\\n\\nPowell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \\nbefore a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and \\ngave a very Michael Powell speech\\x97whimsical, intellectual, and \\nfree-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore\\'s Law)\\x97that \\nbegan by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \\ntelecom companies alive. \"In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \\noften cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,\" Powell said. \"Like the \\nWhos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \\nbeast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \\nderegulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act\\'s \\nfertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \\nleast, so it is thought.\" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \\nchairman he didn\\'t expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \\npart of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \\nof the Bush Administration.\\n\\nTwenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \\nor dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \\nserious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \\ncompanies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \\nconcentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \\ncompanies\\' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \\ngood shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \\ncompanies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \\nfinancial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \\nindustry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \\nwind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \\nif they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \\nduopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \\nAnd these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \\npoor health of the long-distance companies.\\n\\nThe cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \\ncompanies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \\ndon\\'t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \\nfully control what material they allow to enter people\\'s homes. As part \\nof the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \\nTelecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \\nsignificantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \\nradio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \\nper cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \\nprogramming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \\nof Viacom.\\n\\nIn this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \\nbe hyperactive\\x97the superhero of government regulation, springing to the \\nrescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \\nto breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \\ndisallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \\nforces of concentration. It should use the government\\'s money and muscle \\nto get new technology\\x97especially fast Internet connections\\x97into the \\nhomes of people who can\\'t afford it at current market prices. (An \\nanalogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \\nthe Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \\npeople, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \\npeople blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \\nexpectations and stirred too many passions.)\\n\\nBut Michael Powell\\'s F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \\nconducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \\nF.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \\nsignals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \\nthe F.C.C.\\'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn\\'t mean he has \\nbeen inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \\ninfuriates his critics\\x97in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \\nthe provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \\nF.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he\\'s \\nhaving the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \\nwhen he was asked what he was going to do about the \"digital \\ndivide\"\\x97that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet\\x97he said, \\n\"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I\\'d like to have one and \\nI can\\'t afford one.\" At the National Cable & Telecommunications \\nAssociation convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \\ntumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \\nsomersault.\\n\\n\\nNot long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \\n1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \\nWashington, near the city\\'s open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \\nthe western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \\nelse at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \\nlooks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \\nEven the chairman\\'s suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \\nfluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \\nwalks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \\njeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \\nof the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \\nbecame entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \\nthe idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \\nthe market before the fact\\x97\"prophylactically,\" as he likes to say\\x97should \\nwait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \\nlitigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \\nthen became a protégé of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \\nof the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government\\'s \\nlegal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \\nthe New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell\\'s political \\nskill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \\nAdministration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \\nalso maintains close ties to Bush\\'s nemesis Senator John McCain, of \\nArizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \\nenduring love of law school\\x97\"It\\'s sort of like a law-school study \\nsession over there,\" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \\nconfirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \\nstudents, summer interns at the commission, whom he\\'d invited to sit in.\\n\\nI began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \\nof the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \\nairwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\\n\\n\"I think we\\'ll never know,\" Powell said. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s an \\nautomatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \\nthe best analogue. We don\\'t seize all the land in the United States and \\nsay, \\'The government will issue licenses to use land.\\' If my neighbor \\nputs a fence one foot onto my property line, there\\'s a whole body of law \\nabout what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \\na wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it\\'s a \\nsimilar proposition. There are scholars who argue\\x97indeed, the famous \\nRonald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this\\x97that \\nspectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \\nof ways that we\\'re accustomed to.\"\\n\\nTalking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \\ndoesn\\'t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \\nslumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \\nironic air quotes. He\\'s like your libertarian friend in college who \\nenjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \\nabout aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \\nsees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \\nthought his predecessors\\' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \\nAct had been excessive.\\n\\n\"I would start with a caveat,\" Powell said. \"Look, I can\\'t fault those \\njudgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \\nThey were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \\nBut, frankly, I\\'ve always been a little bit critical. First of all, \\nanybody who works with the act knows that it doesn\\'t come anywhere close \\nto matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President \\non down, about the kinds of things it\\'s going to open up. I mean, I \\ndon\\'t know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, \\nor what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that \\nwere a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts \\nreading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. \\nBut, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet \\nexcitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it \\ncertainly was.\\n\\n\"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \\nexpectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the \\neconomy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically \\nexaggerated expectation\\x97by the leadership of the commission, by \\npoliticians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a \\ngold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones \\nthat government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to \\nsee numbers go up on the board.\"\\n\\nPowell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. \" \\n\\'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see \\nthirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the \\nBells to bleed! Then we\\'ll know we\\'ve succeeded.\\' \" Now Powell returned \\nto being Powell. \"I think that expectation was astonishingly \\nunrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they\\'re \\nthere. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And \\nthe market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There\\'s no \\nquestion, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much \\ndebt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business \\nmodel.\"\\n\\nHow could the Telecom Act have been handled better? \"We could have \\nchosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \\nslightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,\" \\nPowell said. \"Money chased what seemed like government-promised \\nopportunity. The problem with that is there\\'s a morning after, and we\\'re \\nin it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \\ndebt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some \\nways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.\"\\n\\nPowell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \\nhad been a more \"reasonable\" level of investment. \"No, we wouldn\\'t have \\nevery home in America with competitive choice yet\\x97but we don\\'t anyway. I \\ndon\\'t think it\\'s the remonopolization of telephone service. I don\\'t buy \\nthat. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn\\'t? The \\npart of the story that didn\\'t materialize was that people thought so \\nwould MCI WorldCom and Sprint.\"\\n\\nOther local phone companies, he added, hadn\\'t materialized as viable \\nbusinesses, either, and they never might. \"Everybody\\'s always saying, \\n\\'The regulators did this and this and this.\\' But, candidly, the story\\'s \\nquite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six \\nyears to give them a chance. Conditions don\\'t get that good except once \\nevery thirty years, and it didn\\'t happen. So, whatever the reason, we\\'re \\nlooking at a WorldCom that\\'s teetering. We\\'re looking at a long-distance \\nbusiness that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is \\nbreaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.\"\\n\\nCould the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies \\nstronger? \"At the F.C.C.? I think I\\'ll just be blunt. My political \\nanswer? Yes, there\\'s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try \\nto help. But I can\\'t find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. \\nI can\\'t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. \\ninvestigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don\\'t have \\nthose kinds of levers. I don\\'t know whether anybody does. At some point, \\ncompanies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \\ndying.\" Powell couldn\\'t have made it much clearer that he doesn\\'t think \\nit\\'s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has \\ndemonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \\ngestures\\x97in August, for example, five months after disbanding the \\nF.C.C.\\'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \\nappointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \\ncommunications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \\nout the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \\nup the telecom industry.\\n\\nI asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one \\ncompany provided cable television and only one provided local phone \\nservice. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It concerns us that there\\'s one of each of \\nthose things, but let\\'s not diminish the importance of there being one \\nof each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications \\ncapabilities, even if they aren\\'t direct analogues of each other.\" \\nAnyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to \\nprovide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will \\nprovide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. \\n\"So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question \\nis, Does it stay that way?\"\\n\\nThe concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \\ninformation did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that \\npeople confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, \\nwhich distorts markets. \"If this were just economics, it\\'s easy. If you \\nwere to say to me, \\'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,\\' we \\nknow how to do that\\x97the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a \\nmarket\\'s too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is \\nother dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take \\nthe question of, if everybody\\'s controlling what you see, the assumption \\nthere is that somehow there\\'ll be this viewpoint, a monolithic \\nviewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won\\'t get diversity. I \\nthink that\\'s a possibility. I don\\'t think it\\'s nearly the possibility \\nthat\\'s ascribed to it sometimes.\"\\n\\nPowell explained, \"Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \\nparochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the \\nsame people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \\nexists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \\nthe planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, \\nand then we have policies like\"\\x97here his tone went from ironic to \\nsarcastic\\x97\"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis \\nof what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed \\nand opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \\nfairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.\"\\n\\n\\nF.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he \\ncan\\'t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \\nhe regulates\\x97so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the \\nmarket, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he\\'s carrying \\nwater for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is \\nplanning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed \\nAttorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn\\'t want to do anything \\nat the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he\\'s \\nwaiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, \\nso that he doesn\\'t wind up going first and getting caught in the \\ncrossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \\nnetworks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \\nTelecom, after Colin Powell\\'s idea that the United States should never \\ncommit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, \\nand an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he \\nsays, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and \\nirreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.\\n\\n\"This is why elections matter,\" Reed Hundt, who isn\\'t happy about what \\nhas become of his Telecom Act, told me. It\\'s true that the F.C.C.\\x97much \\nmore than, say, the war in Afghanistan\\x97is a case in which a Gore \\nAdministration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \\nAdministration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but \\nthere\\'s no question whether communications companies have noticed. The \\narbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \\nhave done if Gore had won. Next election, they\\'ll help the party that \\nhelped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the \\narbocks\\' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks\\' rivals\\x97the \\nlong-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts\\x97with their \\nfriends now in power, will stage a comeback. America\\'s present is not \\nunrecognizably different from America\\'s past.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Something like 100K books published in the US. \\n    Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is \\n    wrong: most aren\\'t pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over \\n    for years on shelves for three months, doesn\\'t sell, that\\'s it, and the \\n    author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. \\n\\n    Oblivion is fate of most books: \"Piracy would be the best thing for those \\n    books.\" People wouldn\\'t pirate them in general, because people generally \\n    like to respect the rights of creators. \"Piracy is a marginal act; it takes \\n    away some of the cream.\" \\n\\n    Publishing won\\'t go away, but it will change the idea of who is a \\n    publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a \\n    publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often \\n    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and \\n    position in bookstores. \\n\\n    Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will \\n    Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? \\n\\n    Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media \\n    companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we\\'re \\n    stuck for a long time with \"some mistakes.\"  \\n\\nLink[1] Discuss[2] (_via Dan Gillmor\\'s eJournal[3]_)\\n\\n[1] http://blog.glennf.com/gmblog/archives/00000254.htm\\n[2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/K3FKZ6jSJe2Px\\n[3] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/ejournal/\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Please see the bottom of this\\nmessage for further information and removal instructions.\\n\\n\\nPARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN\\nHIS CLOSET!\\n\\nDoes this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have\\njust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).\\nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -\\nNew Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when\\nshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried\\nbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old\\nsons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when\\nshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,\\nfifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.\\n\\n\"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", says the 41-year-old\\nwoman, \"There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that\\'s more than my\\nhusband earns in a year\".\\n\\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where\\nhe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away\\nand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did\\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\\nactually finding it in the closet.\\n\\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of \\n\"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday\\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\\ncomputer in his bedroom.\\n\\n\"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name\\non it like the instructions said and I started sending it out\", says the clever\\n15-year-old.\\n\\nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one\\n$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top\\nand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to\\nthe top of the list.\\n\\nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand\\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your\\nname at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk E-mail all the time, and\\nreally did not think it was going to work\", the boy continues.\\n\\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box\\nthat his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions\\nbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.\\n\\n\"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box\\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\\nyellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I\\nwas in trouble or something (laughs)\". He goes on, \"I went up to the\\ncounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back\\nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all\".  Over\\nthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.\"  The\\nmoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the\\ncloset, barely had time for my homework\".He had also been riding his bike\\nto several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, \\nfifties and hundreds.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks\\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the\\nlady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the\\nmoney] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a\\nreally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me\\nand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next\\nbank down the street (laughs).\"  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any\\nreason to be afraid.The reporting news \\n\\nteam examined and investigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was\\nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was\\ncompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,\\nSection 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in\\nthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which\\nstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.\\n\\nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,\\n\"Please send me report number XYX\".This simple note made the letter\\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \\nfive-dollar fee.\\n\\n[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how\\nthe system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What \\nappears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -\\n YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nBE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you\\nsay \"Bull\", please read the following. This is the letter you have been\\nhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\\n Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire\\nshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really\\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are\\n\"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if\\npeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some\\nmegabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost\".\\n\\n\\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS\\nPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER\\nTHAN EVER.\\n\\n\\nNote* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when\\nI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.\\n\\nIn order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so\\nthat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the\\nfollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money\\nfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.\\n\\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was \\napproached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I\\nfinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal\\neffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total\\n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in\".\\n\\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nHere is another testimonial: \"This program has been around for a long time \\nbut I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the\\nmail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions\\nand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I\\nonly made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of\\n$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I\\nhave made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change\\nanything.\" More testimonials later but first,\\n\\nPRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE\\n\\n++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++\\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE \\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE\\nSURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT\\n CORNER in case of any mail problems.\\n\\n When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.\\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.\\nWithin a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from\\nthese 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be\\naccessible for you to send to the 1,000\\'s of people who will order them from\\nyou. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case\\nsomething happens to your computer.\\n\\n\\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next\\nto each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is\\ninstructed below in step \"1 through 6\" or you will loose out on majority of\\nyour profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see\\nhow it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been\\ntested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their\\nfriends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.\\nBut it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy\\nand then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than\\nwhat is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,\\nhonesty reaps the reward!!!\\n\\n\\n1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and\\nREMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person\\nhas made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.\\n2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.\\n3....

DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a\\ndisk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing\\nyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you\\nwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk\\ne-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much\\nmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:\\n\\n\\nMETHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will\\nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let\\'s\\nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response\\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people\\nwill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\\n\\n\\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10\\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals\\n100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\\norders for Report #5. THAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES\\n$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:\\n1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......\\nGrand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\\nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\\nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment\\nwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people\\nmailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on \\nthe Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just\\nthat, and more!\\n\\n\\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of\\nFREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will\\neasily get a larger response.\\n\\n\\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as\\nyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the\\nReport they ordered. That\\'s it. Always provide same day service on all\\norders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name\\nand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they\\nreceive the report.\\n\\n=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always\\nsend $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT\\naccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2\\nsheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write\\nthe NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL \\nADDRESS and your name and postal address.\\n\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nREPORT #1: The Insider\\'s Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\\n\\nOrder Report #1 from:\\nR.

If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until\\nyou do.\\n\\n+++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN\\nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will\\ncontinue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different\\nreport. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE\\nMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START\\nTHE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you\\ncan generate from this business!!!\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS\\nPROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you\\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A\\nLITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few\\nweeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program\\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works\\nexceedingly well as it is now.\\n\\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your\\nname and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as\\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out\\n100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.\\nRemember though, the more you send out the more potential customers\\nyou will reach.

       " 'Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):\\n\\n> What is the GPL all about then?\\n\\n(1) I\\'m sure you are not _actually_ under the delusion that everything\\non a typical Linux distribution issued subject to the terms of the GNU\\nGPL.  For one thing, it seems difficult to imagine you _not_ being aware\\nthat XFree86 is under the X/MIT licence, that Perl is under the Perl\\nArtistic Licence, that Apache is under the Apache licence, and that\\nnumerous BSD utilities are under the BSD licence.\\n\\nFurthermore, xv, Acrobat Reader, pine, pico, Netscape Communicator, and\\na whole slew of other applications typically included aren\\'t under any\\nopen source licence at all, but rather are proprietary.\\n\\n(2) You seem, in any event, to be under a misconception as to what the\\nGPL provides, as to code under its umbrella.  It says (in part) that\\n_if_ you have lawfully received a copy of covered binary code, then you\\nmay insist on one of certain forms of access to the matching source\\ncode.  Please note that it does _not_ guarantee you any rights\\nwhatsoever if nobody\\'s decided to give you a lawful copy.\\n\\n> But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It\\'s not theirs to BSD!\\n\\nAgain, you seem to be under a misconception.  If you check, I\\'m quite\\nconfident you\\'ll see that SuSE are in full compliance with GPL v. 2\\'s\\nsource-code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their\\ndistribution.  And no, nobody has the legal right to alter licence terms\\nto someone else\\'s copyrighted property.  But you have not cited any\\nreasons to believe that SuSE have done any of those things.\\n \\n> Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other than put up the ftp\\n> version, but surely they can\\'t prevent a CD owner from burning a copy\\n> and giving it to me?\\n\\nSee below.  You and the CD owner would be committing copyright violation.\\nSuSE Linux AG are rather unlikely to knock down your door and haul you\\ndown to a judge, if that\\'s what you\\'re asking.\\n\\n> Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I\\'m not\\n> asking for that. I\\'m asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL\\'ed) to\\n> burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange for a reasonable\\n> consideration (say, the price of the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a\\n> couple of pints?).\\n\\nYou appear confused between Linux the kernel (which is a copyrighted\\nwork to which source code access is guaranteed under the GNU GPL if\\nyou\\'ve received a lawful copy of a binary version) and the rather\\nimprecise concept of a \"Linux distribution\", which is a number of works\\nunder diverse licence terms collected onto some media.\\n\\nIn the case of SuSE\\'s boxed sets -- which are NOT lawful to duplicate\\nand redistribute in their entirety -- at least a couple of the\\napplications on them (YaST, YaST2, and the installer program) are\\nproprietary copyrighted works of SuSE Linux AG.  In the general case,\\nduplicating and redistributing CD-ROMs containing those works is\\ncopyright infringement.  Illegal.  No amount of hand-waving about the\\nGNU GPL is going to change that.\\n\\n(SuSE permit people to duplicate and redistribute the \"evaluation\" and\\n\"live-eval\" CD editions, despite that fact, as long as it is not \"for\\nvalue\".)\\n\\nIf you want to have a SuSE boxed set to install from, buy one.\\n\\n> What does the GPL mean now?\\n\\nSuggestion:  Read it.

       " 'nri number oneexpats help hindi films make dollars and sense even at their own expenseby jeanne e fredriksenthe expatriate in films is nothing new casablanca starring humphrey bogart as the suave mysterious rick in morocco remains the top favorite  years after its release in america although expat characters lives are traditionally painted as being extraordinary the simple fact that they live elsewhere adds a sense of adventure a dash of romance and a bit of wishful longing however expats have never made the kind of impact on films that nonresident indians nris have with hindi cinema both at the box office and on the big screenaccording to indias  census the countrys population exceeded the  billion persons milestone and there are approximately  million indians living working and studying elsewhere around the world nris have become a serious market for the hindi film industry particularly in the uk where approximately  percent of the population is indianpakistani and in the us where  million out of  million people are indian the rupee box office is now augmented quite handsomely by the dollarandpound box office much to the delight of directors and producersamong the films reporting a halftothreequartersofamilliondollar box office in the us or the uk are aa ab laut chalen  kaho naa pyaar hai  refugee  lajja  and asoka  the nri milliondollarboxoffice club boasts such films as yaadein  and lagaan  in the us taal  hum saath saath hain hssh  and mohabbatein  made the mark or better in the uk taal and hssh doubled their uk intakes in the us and brought in  million each kuch kuch hota hai  tallied up  million in the uk most recently setting a new highwater mark in the overseas box office kabhi khushi kabhie gham kg  grabbed the no  spot its first week of release in the us and earned  million during its fiveweek run in the uk kg earned nearly  million over an  week runimpressive yes considering that promotion of hindi films outside of the indian community is virtually zero although that may be on the brink of changing slightly if nothing else the figures indicate that the nri spends a big chunk of change on the filmsduring the past decade the inclusion of nri characters in both commercial and noncommercial films has been on the rise and in a circular logic its only natural that they have become a part of these films stories each nri touches someone in india and these global indians as filmmaker subhash ghai has called them cannot be shrugged off as a passing phase films featuring or made for nris have been criticized by some in india but in reality many of those films have performed extremely well at the indian box office could this speak to the lure of adventure and the romance of the nrithe first hindi blockbuster to spotlight nri characters was dilwale dulhania le jayenge ddlj  the story of two young people who grew up indian in london ddlj introduced us to the mischievous prankpulling raj who in the beginning fails to graduate but succeeds in pilfering a case of beer from an indianowned convenience store in the end he steadfastly applies indian sensibilities in his pursuit of the rebelliousbuttrapped simran as her unwanted arranged marriage approaches very possibly because of this juxtaposition of traits attitudes and events ddlj enjoys the distinction of being the longestcontinuallyrunning film in indian cinema historypopularity aside there is the ongoing issue regarding accuracy in the characterization of nris in films often they are drawn as stereotypes which are easy to lean on requiring neither depth nor dimension because of this hindi filmmakers may be said to straddle the border separating east and west staying securely at home and dipping into their highlyfantasized world of the indian diasporain many cases commercial hindi films present an overlydevised sense of the nri as being either corruptlywesternized or as being more homesick than a child gone away to camp for the first time while these concepts may carry a certain truth the corresponding misconceptions come from the minds of the athome indians who wag a seeminglyenvious finger at the nris ability to exist in two worlds one allowing space and upward mobility the other offering traditions and historypompous materialistic alcoholdrinking cigarettesmoking drugtaking affairhaving spoiled brats \\x85the first hindi film i saw was subhash ghais pardes  despite encouraging me to see more films it made me wonder if nri actually meant not really indian if the nri characters werent silly whiney troublemakers they were mean and nasty embracing every possible negative human quality in stark contrast to the pristine kusum ganga even the dialogue and song lyrics in the film were designed to instruct the viewer that the west is inferior but one can still bring india back into ones life the film is propaganda at its finest and filled with relentless reminders of good vs evil purity vs corruption right vs wrong traditional vs modern \\x85 in short india vs the westbut this is not where the negativity endsvery often there is a dress code for the female characters to help the viewer understand her measure of purity or wickedness the more traditionallydressed the more indian the woman unsurprisingly this does not seem to carry over to the mens charactersrunning alongside this can be the training guide in which nris are constantly reeducated that this is not india \\x85 this is not america \\x85 only in india \\x85 this is our culture the repetition seems less designed to be a natural part of life than to foster reinforcement as if nris are too ignorant to appreciate it the first timewhen indians achieve success and wealth have large homes and own their companies in these films they are industrious clever and respected businessmen the nri equivalent is held up to a double standard and considered materialistic even the printed synopsis of taal in the eros entertainmentbu dvd booklet refers to the nri characters world of ruthless materialism on the other hand the mumbaibased plagiarizing vikrant kapoor character is likeable enough and presented as an opportunist which seems to be a step upitaly is an unlikely origin for an nri and offspring in a hindi film but hum dil de chuke sanam  filled the bill for all the films splendor it was regrettable that the indoitalian sameer was presented as a naïve bumbling nerd who had little going for him beyond his singing abilityyaadein gave us a kind and loving if slightly confused single parent from london raising three daughters who suffer enough issues to put a therapist into a tailspin as if that werent enough the film includes an americanraised brat who wants nothing to do with parents settling down or having babies\\x97hardly the ideal indian bridetobeand what happens when a married nri couple splits into the modern vs the oldfashioned the wife is tossed out like the garbage and sent home to india as punishment for being unreceptive to having affairs outside of marriage such is the initial setup for lajja rajkumar santoshis look into the world of indian womenshow me the way to go home \\x85the other extreme of nris in film is the homesick culturecraving morepatrioticthanthou indian building their own miniindias for maximemories this nri portrayal takes a real issue and magnifies it to unreal proportions and no film illustrates that as extravagantly as the lush and sumptuous kabhi khushi kabhi gham kgnot only did kg enjoy a healthy run at home it exploded worldwide onto theater screens in indian communities last december and played to packed houses for weeks and kg is a film in which everything\\x97homes transportation finances fashion holidays events emotions and tears\\x97sets a new standard for the term largerthanlifein kg much of the postinterval footage takes place in england for anjali life in london simmers with a patriotic zeal and an allconsuming homesickness manifested in the meticulous maintenance of indian customs and rituals while she separates herself from her surroundings her need for india is so overwhelming that she relies on the false protection of mocking people and places outside of her own family and homeoverkill certainly as writerdirector karan johars inflated representation of what have become some of the filmi passions of the typical nri but when it boils down to the common denominators without the fanfare flash and fervor even those who move across country miss their families and familiar surroundings one always retains a credible amount of hometurf loyalty and if ones heritage is lost the person is rendered as no more than a racial statisticthose living in india are surrounded by our culture every minute even if they dont realize it says vivek malhotra a thirtysomething nri and business owner in the chicago area here its different but we will always be indian he continues striking at the heart of the perceived problem sometimes i feel that the movies think weve forgotten that maybe the filmmakers should spend some time finding out who we are i really dont think they have a clueon the upside is a beneficial aspect for the children of nris its good that these films show our kids what happens in india\\x97the traditions customs values says parag gandhi a long time theater owner and promoter of hindi films in chicago they may be modernized in india but the traditional values remain and many popular films target the lateteens twentysomething demographic films such as dilwale dulhania le jayenge kuch kuch hota hai and kg adds gandhi are examples of films that are half traditional half modern striking a balance between the two for all of the marketsanother positive consideration is that not all films show nris in a questionable light caricatures of nris have been challenged in commercial films like kaho naa pyaar hai dil chhata hai  monsoon wedding  and the recent kitne door kitne paas all of which present nris as more realistic more human characters aa ab laut chalen offers a variety of nri personalities from the selfish the conniving and the party animal to the lovable cabbies and the panditcop who make the best of their situations without complaint interestingly the film also dares to include shop owners dunkin donuts clerks gas station attendants characters who arent weighed down by palatial surroundings corporate crises or overseas judgmentsthe us the uk and australia are represented in bombay boys  by three young men comingreturning to bombay india for personal reasons in a refreshing reversal of the typical attitude concerning nris in film the boys are the good indians and everyone they meet has some relationship with the darker side of the city at its most basic the film shows that if something is lost it wont necessarily be found in indiaeven the noncommercial multiawardwinning bawandar  incorporates an nri as a connecting thread in the piecing together of sanvri devis story curious passionate about womens rights the indoenglish journalist represents the fact that the story has a wider interest than a small rural villagestepping outside of the hindi film industry for a moment the englishtelegu film hyderabad blues  and the englishtamil film mitr\\x97my friend  both smallerbudget films built on delivering messages without preaching deserve mention the former engages in the questioning of rather than the criticism of east vs west and the latter examines the challenges faced by women nris and their families the characters and stories of both films enjoy respect in their presentation partially due to the existence of layered issues that are revealed and resolved or not without fingersnapping swiftness or clichéd answers hyderabad blues enjoyed a week run in mumbai alone and mitr\\x97my friend is currently one of the mostrented films in indian communities in the uswhile the inclusion of nris in hindi films does not guarantee box office success outside of india it does send a strong signal that filmmakers acknowledge this constantly growing and lucrative audience sector if the bigbudget big boxoffice commercial films coming out of mumbai often seem to bite one of the hands that feeds it has the box office anywhere been adversely affected well \\x85 no not by any charted reports that can be found and that itself sends a loud and clear message back to the industry in mumbai if it isnt broken dont fix itnevertheless when filmmakers who see nris as falling only to the evil side of western ways look beyond their assumptions perhaps they will discard their reliance on stereotypes and start paying their overseas family an increased measure of respect and when filmmakers who take the homesick and patriotic themes beyond believability analyze their own feelings perhaps they will realize that what nris hold dear in their hearts is no different from what those at home should be proud of nnote all box office figures are reported as us and are courtesy of variety magazine online archives not all hindi films abroad report box office and not all box office reports are availablejeanne e fredriksen writes from chicago she is family with friends with acquainted with and works for nris with an amazing variety of personalities attitudes hopes dreams goals livelihoods needs wants and beliefs\\xa0dilwale dulhaniya le jayengeso globally successful is the film that in  it warranted a billboard outside shinjuku train station in tokyo japan announcing its screenings sponsored by india center there shinjuku is the entertainment center of tokyo and there is plenty of highprofile competition for attention attendance and box office in japan where indian films enjoy a certain popularity with the natives the countrys  population census of  million persons showed only  were indian with an additional  being other south asians without question ddlj continues to be a favorite whenever wherever offered for

hottest items circulating on the island hong kongs  population census of  million people revealed that  were indian and another  were nepalese and pakistani kgs popularity in the special

burbank the think tanks executive director but it wascommon senseresearch by his nonprofit economic opportunity institute showed thatpeople preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso

aides dispute his figures saying their researchshows the tax would bring in  million to  million a yearburbanks institute is funded by foundations and labor unions thethink tanks mission is to promote public policy in the interests oflowincome people and it has long championed childcare issuesburbank says the tax would restore cuts to the childcare programsmade earlier this year by gov gary locke

audituniversity of chicago economics professor michael greenstone said the tax doesnt add up the purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable and this isneither he said on the efficiency side its surely going to leadto costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways toavoid the tax for example starbucks could claim that they are usingfinely ground coffee instead of coffee run though an espresso makerand that consequently they are exempt from the tax would they beright i dont know but finding out will surely take lots of legalfees that could have gone to child careof course from a publicrelations perspective this is an ingeniousidea and i mean that in a cynical way theyve pitted espressodrinkers against childcare supporters and whos going to side withthe espresso drinkersin fact the proposed tax has forced opponents into a politicaltwostep where their criticism must remain a beat behind their publicstance of political correctness in a liberal city like

but letsjust say it is only  also many people will sendout hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only eachcontinuing with this example you send out only emails with a  response that is only orders for report   those  people respondedby sending out  emails each for a total of out of those  emails only responded with orders thats  people whoresponded and ordered report  those  people mail

       " 'url date tso i was researching the history of the tilde because d told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any url with a tilde in it presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time which to be honest is probably accurate given the nature of her work but never mind that i dont want to talk about corporate politics i want to talk about the tilde every commandlineloving geek will tell you that  stands for home directory and cd  will take you to your home directory cd username will take you to someone elses except on mac os x where it will take you to their public file sharing directory it is from this heritage that we can trace the presentday practice of using tildes in urls to denote personal pages since one single systemwide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory or more commonly now that apache has taken over the world in their publichtml subdirectory except on mac os x where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to  youre actually being served files from that users sites directory within their home directory but i dont want to talk about mac os x i want to talk about the tilde as with so many other things i find that jukka korpela is the expert in this field jukka is no doubt a member of my karass a word which google old habits die hard feels is best explained by the personal site of eugene wallingford which like jukkas home page can not be referenced without a tilde in fact jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in urls a treatise which i feel obliged to point out contains a tilde in its url clearly the tilde is underappreciated digging further we find this post of jukkas from  in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all but rather an odd character called the overline presumably to balance out the underline if indeed those sorts of things require balance there is balance in the universe to be sure but i am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard no matter the tilde was the tilde so that spanishtyping types could type the ntilde now referenced in html as the named entity ntilde but somewhere along the line it morphed into a generalpurpose character with all sorts of geeky uses digging even further it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for  then an alternate for  and its life as an overline replacement came even later jukka confirms this and adds a timeline  for   for   for overline then june   the watershed moment in an x committee meeting when it was proposed as exclusively a tilde in usa to appease share i can find no further reference as to what this acronym means or what this committee meeting was about the next reference isnt until  when the tilde was officially added to iso and now down the rabbit hole we go scouring usenet which the kids of yesterday called deja news and kids today call google groups we find a reprint of a  william safire yes that william safire article on language in which we learn that  is officially pronounced squiggle this is confirmed by the jargon dictionary to this very day im not sure this is useful but i just thought it was cool to see william safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ascii characters as early as august  tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem in july  kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde in february  an editors note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that fidonet supported ascii characters space through tilde as early as january  less used the tilde to denote lines past eof as early as july  troff supported the tilde in november  a modsources post refers to bourne shell enhancements historytildejob control as early as january  tilde was included on the dec keyboard and listed in the apl character set in april  tilde was causing bugs in vi actually due to underlying bugs in csh in december   is officially pronounced tilde prompting this typographical pun and thats the earliest reference i can find so where does that leave us unsatisfied no doubt there is history here but there are gaps what happened at that watershed meeting in  how did the tilde rise to prominence in the s when did it become a synonym for home directory when did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites i dont know and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research a failing for which i apologize profusely goodnight goodnight may you dream of tildes stars and whorls',\n",

work it this really works dont make the same mistake i made i deleted this  times before finally giving it a try within  weeks the orders money started coming in just like the plan below said it would give it a try you will be glad you did thanks and good luck you wont need luck just keep reading dont delete this  first read about how a  year old made  see below as seen on national tv this is the media report parents of   year old  find  cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods  new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her yearold sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash fivedollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds  all neatly rubberbanded in labeled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the yearold woman there was over  dollars in that bag  thats more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the cardealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via email a type of report to email addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past  months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the email one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever yearold the email letter listed  addresses and contained instructions to send one  dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in fivedollar bills within  weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the address list i get junk email all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the email the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his videogame magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing  bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had  magazine and about  envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the email the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the  bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didnt want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the socalled chainletter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chainletter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title  section  and  or title  section  in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume  sections  and  which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every fivedollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number xyxthis simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service a report on howto for a fivedollar fee this is the end of the media

mash note i had never heard thisterm before but i extrapolated that it is some sort of love noteis there a more specific meaning than a simple love note and canyou give some insight as to the origin of the term janerosenthal californiaa youre right about the meaning of the phrasewe have to go back some way to find the origin the first form wasthe word mash by itself this was a slang term in the us in thes for an infatuation or crush a magazine in  defined it asa deep but fleeting affection of the heart a mash could alsobe a dandy or the object of ones affection of either sex or  asa verb  to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sexto flirt or seduce a masher was a man who thought himselfirresistible to the female sex but whose advances were oftenunwelcomethe evidence collected by professor lighter in the random househistorical dictionary of american slang and by others suggeststhat it was originally a term used in and around the theatrecharles godfrey leland best known for his hans breitmann\\x92sballads about a german immigrant wrote a note above his poemthe masher dated about  confirming this  the word to mash in the sense of causing love or  attracting by a glance or fascinating look came into  ordinary slang from the american stage thus an actress  was often fined for mashing or smiling at men in the  audiencemash and its derivatives crossed the atlantic to britain about masher in particular became a term in london societyespecially among the more raffish supperclub and theatregoingclasses for a type of fashionable male the oxford englishdictionary defines it with a distinctly maidenly air of drawingaway its collective skirts as a fop of affected manners andexaggerated style of dress who frequented musichalls andfashionable promenades and who posed as a ladykiller notingthat the word had been common in  and for a few years afterin a letter from london in the old overland monthly and out westmagazine in  a correspondent described a member of animpoverished theatrical company this dashing youth was distinctlyconscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed besideus and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances thatsuperbly took them in would be a lesson for champion mashers of afar higher classa mash note in its first appearances mash letter was anobvious enough extension a love letter it is recorded first in and  as you have discovered  is still doing wellwhere mash and its relatives come from has been a subject ofdebate it is sometimes said that it is from the standard englishword meaning to make soft by one of various means with its obviousreference to rendering the object of ones attentions pliable andyielding max beerbohm writing in london in  mashers werestill around then despite the oeds comment remarked that somepeople derived it from ma chère the mode of address used by thegilded youth to the barmaids of the period but he thought itreally came from the chorus of a song which at that time had agreat vogue in the musichalls im the slashing dashing mashingmontmorency of the day were pretty sure now that he was wrongbut he could hardly know thatback to charles leland again apart from his humorous writings healso researched and wrote a great deal about the romany language aswell as gypsy songs and customs the following note from theintroduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widelyaccepted  it was introduced by the wellknown gypsy family of actors  c among whom romany was habitually spoken the word  masher or mash means in that tongue to allure delude  or entice it was doubtless much aided in its popularity by  its quasiidentity with the english word but there can be  no doubt as to the gypsy origin of mash as used on the  stage i am indebted for this information to the late well  known impresario palmer of new york and i made a note of  it years before the term had become at all popularthough defunct in british english mash and masher have neverquite gone away in america mash had a resurgence of popularityas student slang in the s in the sense of necking or pettingthough that may be a backformation from mash note endnotea

this growth and in this order india china pakistan nigeriabangladesh and indonesiathus though fertility is declining unexpectedly in a poor country likeindia which has more than a billion people the

friday michael why is it that people who consider voting in an election an  inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message   dont get me wrong  i think this is the case  people will go to  see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to  express their malice and discontent towards not only the present  regime in america but also the corrupt empty shallow pantomime  which cast them into power in reality today the voting that takes place via the act of  consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth  and dimpling the appropriate chad or some other such convoluted act  of free democratic expression why  because in america they believe in dollars  dollars dont lie   in practise they are the last frontier of truth in america  universally accepted as expressions of fear desire passion and  need  compared to the swing of the almighty buck and jeb bush knows  this a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning given that fact i modestly propose an entirely new though wholly  logical extension to the current democratic system in place in  america i propose we augment and effectively replace the electoral system  with a political stock market  we should accept that politicians are  entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in america and  embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects  their intent  a politician should issue a constant number of shares  dependent upon his tenure in government  those shares should be  traded on an open exchange say the greed short of course for  the global realists electoral exchange  democratic  politicians  we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their  ability to maintain office grows  as the truth about their embezzling  campaign funds for weekend trips to maui with their interns is  revealed of course their fortunes will fall this represents an opportunity for the market forces  those same  forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal  protest  to voice their opinion on the quality of americas  governance during the intervening four years between elections   elections themselves will in effect become meaningless as they are  now since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each  and every congressman senator and presidential candidate just think of the coverage that could be given on msnbc  strom  thurman strom news  quotes was down  today on fears that his  latest heart operation will render him unable to attend senate armed  services committee meetings until november  this would provide  rejuvenating content to the econopolitical news sector which has  found posteconomicbubble coverage to be both tiresome and  deoressing  the establishment of this new stock exchange would of  course create jobs for newly unemployed and governmentally retrained  it systems engineers who could after passing the electoral securities  exam become floor traders this would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which  candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their  multibilliondollar campaigns  the requirement for the support of  legions of spin doctors permanent campaign managers and investor  relations personnel would also create jobs  perhaps even a new  practice for ernst  young arthur anderson et al  insider trading  scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch  martha stewart as an unwitting beneficiary thus spreading her  influence to politics dividends if there are any on record at the close of a politicians  career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings   pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support  necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the beltway set   union funds brokerages and even pumpanddump houses could benefit  from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the  southeast and the bush governmet would be allowed to place social  security bets where they really mattered   investors who lose their  retirement life savings and support could rest assured that they  were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors although theres no way to protect any of these for worldcomlike  crashes ambitious inspired district attorneys could file criminal  suits against candidates and campaign managers who underperform  expectations thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty   instead they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves on the whole i believe the system could work  i could certainly work  as well as our beloved securities trading industry and given the  american electoral systems success at effectively expressing the will  of the people it certainly couldnt do any worse in the meantime mike i think ill go see your movie and try to  depose the president ian on wednesday october   at  pm michael moores mailing  list wrote october   my film bowling for columbine opens this friday dear friends fans and fellow evildoers i am very happy and excited to tell you that this friday october   my new film bowling for columbine will open in new york and los angeles it is i promise the last thing the bushies want projected on the  movie screens across america this week the film is first and foremost a devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for  profit and power  and no one in all the advance screenings i have  attended has left the theatre with anything short of rage i truly believe this  film has the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do  something this is not good news for junior and company not when they are  trying to drag us into another war not when a crazed sniper is exercising his constitutional right to own a highpowered rifle not when john  ashcroft is still prohibiting the fbi from looking through the gun background  check files to see if any of the  hijackers or their associates purchased  any weapons prior to   because that we are told would violate  these terrorists sacred second amendment rights yes i believe this movie can create a lot of havoc  but i will  need all of you to help me do this are you game last february th i wrote to tell you about a book i had written and  how the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to  publish anything critical of bush after  i appealed to you to save  stupid white men from the shredder and to go out and buy it i promised you  would not regret it and that the book would not only be a great read but an important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of george w bush within  hours the book went to  on the amazon best seller list  by the fifth day the book was already into its th

nd printing this is all because of  you my crazy and loyal friends you made this happen against all the odds now i would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work  bowling for columbine its a movie that many critics have already called my  best film to date they may be right it is certainly the most provocative  thing i have ever done i have spent three years on it and i have to say  it cuts deeper harder and funnier that anything i have given you so far the movie opens this friday in new york and los angeles and then in   more cities next week how it does in these first ten cities will determine whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it that is the  nutty way our films are released if it doesnt have a big opening weekend you  can kiss the film goodbye therefore this weekend this film must be  seen by millions of americans can you help me make that happen bowling for columbine is not a film simply about guns or school shootings that is only the starting point for my hour journey into the dark  soul of a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of  violence both at home and around the world with this movie i have broadened my canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the st century a nation that seems hellbent on killing first and asking questions later it is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and terrorism against our own poor and how we have created a culture of  fear that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore and its a devastating comedy this film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts no film has  ever said the things i am saying in bowling for columbine i expect to be attacked i expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of retribution i expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many  to swallow this is why i need your help movies live or die based on what  happens at the box office the first weekend of its release i need you if you  live in the new york or la area to go see bowling for columbine this  friday and saturday  and take as many family members and friends with you as possible i guarantee you will not be disappointed  and you may  just see one of the best films of the year monday night in times square bowling for columbine had its  premiere the crowd was amazing as it was this past saturday night at the chicago  film festival the audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line the hate mail the threats the promises of retribution have already started to roll in to the distributor of this movie united artists they are  not backing down but how long will this last i need all of you in the  new york tristate and southern california areas to go see bowling for  columbine this weekend  the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when  it comes to your town a strong opening not only means that the rest of america will see this film it means that a good number of people who see it  are going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved  if it does poorly i will have a difficult time finding the funding for the  movie i want to make next  a film about  and how bush is using that  tragic day as a cover for his rightwing agenda dont let that happen dont let the nra have one more success by  stopping the wider distribution of this movie and together let us not remain silent in our opposition to bushs phony war against iraq if you live in new york you can see it at the lincoln plaza the  sunshine and the loews th st in la you can catch it at the sunset  the westwood regent laemmle sunset laemmle towncenter encino landmark rialto pasadena and regal university irvine also please  forward this to your

       " 'hamzas horrid  but we must tolerate himrod liddlewednesday august  the guardiansheikh abu hamza almasri our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeymanto scare the kiddies spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playingwith his own children in victoria park hackneyive often wondered what incendiary islamic fundamentalist clerics do onstatutory public holidays head for the beach and maybe swing by bq on theway home i had hoped i had this beguiling vision of hamza paddling in thesea an icecream cone in his one good hand the waves tickling his shinsand the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchenfor once instead of planning the extermination of zionism and america andmaybe me and you toobut bq and a day at the seaside is probably beyond hamzas budget since thebank of england froze his assets so victoria park had to do but he soundedhappy enough when i spoke to him with the babble of tiny cheerful islamicprotowarriors in the backgroundyou must know hamza hes the imam designed it would seem by the dailymails cartoonist mac large metal hook in place of a left hand one eyecovered by a patch the other a baleful watchful milkywhite we dontmock the disabled any more these days unless its someone like hamza whomwe dont like then if youll excuse the inapt phraseology the gloves comeoff so hamza is known with that vaulting imagination typical of thebritish right as captain hook in articles which usually call for hisarrest or extradition to the us or deportation back home to egypt or maybeoff to pakistan or afghanistan where he fought the russians for years andthus sustained his disabilities  anywhere really just out of here and ifwe cant lock him up or chuck him out of the country maybe we can force himto shut upbecause we dont like hamza very much we werent that fond of him beforeseptember  but afterwards in that nervy paranoid few months when we allthought the sky might fall in our disapprobation turned into politicalpersecutionand now the daily mirror is agitating again for his arrest because theyvegot hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatorymanner urging warfare on and looting of enemies of islam all out ofcontext and a very long time ago says the imam not unduly bothered butperhaps he should be because our reputation for broadmindedness andtolerance towards people like hamza was thinning even before the mirrorsscoophamza preaches or preached at the scary finsbury park mosque  so earlierthis year the charity commissioners banned him from doing so because of hisallegedly inflammatory remarks i didnt know charity commissioners weremeant to do stuff like thathe has had his passport seized and not returned his assets have beenfrozen he is tailed by the police every now and then and his access to themedia is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporationsand the press and this last point is because we tell ourselves endlessly repeating the mantra over and over again and fervently wishing it to betrue  hamza is not representative of british muslims as if britishmuslims were a simple homogenous thing with a single voice that one couldturn to every now and then for explanation and perhaps succourthe trouble is in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he wasrevealed to be rather more representative than the list of thosegovernmentapproved muslim spokesmen who were  uncomfortably i suspect dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorismand a blanket condemnation of the talibanan opinion poll commissioned by radio s today programme revealed that anoverwhelming majority of british muslims were against george bushs crusadeone in six were to put it mildly ambivalent about the attack on the usthe remainder condemned the attack unequivocally a large majority thoughtthe war against terrorism was a war against islamwhich is what hamza said repeatedly but it was something that at thetime we didnt want to hear now if you quiz the man on present policy athome and abroad he comes across  superficially at least  as someone fromthe liberal left no war against iraq britain to become independent of usforeign policy and attempt rapprochement with arab states stronger actionagainst israel mistrust of global capitalism redistribution of wealthnor is he particularly antisemitic so far as i can tell although i dontsuppose he will be holidaying in eilat this year in yesterdays guardianthe chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to hamza and was gratefulfor the sheikhs message of condolence when a london synagogue was attackedwhich is not to say that hamza is a peaceable jeffersonian democrat who hasbeen wilfully misrepresented he is without question rather moreinflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public hisideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of islam he would behappy in a truly islamic society to stone women to death for adultery forexample you and i would find many  perhaps most  of his views utterlyrepellentand thats the point because hamza is the true test of our apparent desireto be multicultural multiculturalism is not surely the cheerfulappropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by theruling hegemony that is a sort of syncopated monoculturalismmulticulturalism is rather the ability of society to tolerate views thatare antithetical to the dominant culture  and maybe learn from themthe fbi has been investigating hamza but of course has found nothingremotely incriminating the real reason for his vilification and persecutionis simply the pungency of his viewsit is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because hisrhetoric increases hostility against the muslim population generally thisis a perfectly noble argument but it does not washyou dont defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesnt exist andif british muslims  maybe a minority maybe not  feel a growing sense ofunease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy it isnot because they have been led in that direction by hamza shutting the manup therefore wont make a differenceit is rather as louis macneice had itthe glass is falling hour by hour the glass will fall for everbut if you break the bloody glass you wont hold up

       " 'forewordafter thirtythree years of being a black man living in ghetto america an environment notorious for danger crime and poverty i have made startling discoveries involving young africanamerican men and women who comprise what i have come to define as the black generation x i have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young africanamericans from the general definition of generation x aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed baby boomers its important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young africanamerican culture i have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth childhood and young adult life taken from a web site entitled generation x created and maintained by the colorado college the definition is as follows   we are a group of people born between  and  we are individuals who live for the here and now like to experiment and who require immediate results we are typically selfish and cynical and depend a lot on our parents we question authority and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations its that simple it seems we have come to be called xers simply because we represent something negative to our elders we may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings of course they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility or actually their fault our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worsewe are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school it appears we have little hope for the future no jobs no homes and basically no money are almost expected of us these bleak prospects along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever do not provide much hope some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood as our saviors we will soon discover who is right and who is wrong this definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that generation x is comprised of one core group of american citizens it over generalizes the similarities it expresses and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years when in fact these similarities speak primarily to only white issues and concerns for instance they say we depend a lot on our parents but in ghetto america we could only depend on one \\x85our mothers they also say    we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations and     we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever in ghetto america no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now and is all we have time for i have known for many years that the differences that separate generation xers black and white occupants would eventually be identified i never knew i would be the one doing it extracting the black from generation x and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency without doing so the social ills that plague ghetto america would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective american identitythere are many hidden truths that exist in black america today white america charges that we spend our time collecting welfare refusing to vote reading elementary styled books watching music videos day dreaming of becoming rappers basketball players selling drugs and making babies much of this is supported in marlon riggss documentary entitled ethnic notions when african americans are mentioned whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book a reality that i confirmed while watching roger  me another documentary written and directed by michael moore sadly many of us have begun to validate this skewed image while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for bet black entertainment television many of us fail to realize that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal should be taken as an opportunity to improve empower enlighten and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behaviorregarding black women i have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities i began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a wholethat black men owed them something and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives be it emotional physical or economical normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended in most cases it has not been its funny though looking back i am surprised i never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to or the various schools of thought they possessed many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the africanamerican male some fair and some unfair much of what the public believes and understands about the black females social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is what originally sparked my attention was an observation i stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction i noticed virtually all of the books i read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent africanamerican perspective these stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all africanamericans thrive on a middletoupper class professional level they relay stories of relationship problems with huxtablelike bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love as i read these stories i couldnt help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or working class africanamericans although there are those in the black community that can identify with the huxtablelike dynamic unfortunately they are few and far between the majority of stories i have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued black america the black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our dirty laundry the fact is truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind i recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal as our discussion intensified i reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed and oftentimes not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself the purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the selfdestructive thinking and selfimprisoning behavior that black male and female generation x have been subscribing to while discussing this with my friend she suggested i simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what im attempting to convey acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood i suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrativeto grab a dictionary dont feel badthere were several times i had to as wellregarding black men an overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool buying sports wear driving expensive cars wearing gold or platinum jewelry and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions i have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of africanamerican culture because i have lived it i have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level it is a world of ignorance selfishness preoccupation and idiocyin my world there are people who applaud a lack of education who brag about having served time in us penitentiaries the types of guns they carry dope peddling and chasing women they champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit in this world wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like theyve got a million its a world where children dress in overpriced sports wear mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye thinking such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define ones selfworth and the possible corruption this thinking breeds seems to not be an important concern for black mothers it may come as a shock to know that most africanamericans feel that those who dont have the same if not better material possessions are lesser beings referring to them as being corny lame or broke even our male rapper entertainers promote backward prioritiesnothing else matters as long as you look good the big tymers a popular rap duo have a song called im still fly shown in heavy rotation on bet and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country fly is ghetto vernacular for well dressed also used to describe a females beauty its signature verse assertsi got gator boots with a pimped out guccisuit cant pay my rent cause all my moneysspent but thats ok cause im still flyworse yet in the song grinding the popular duo eclipse glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video the term grinding is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs the fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on bet is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil some of the key lyrics to this song are grinding\\x85you know what i keep in the lining the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs andpatty cake patty cake im the bakers mani bake them cakes as fast as i canand you can tell cause of how my bread stack upand i disguise it as rap so the feds backupin this verse the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack when created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake hence the term cake or sometimes pie unfortunately for the rap genre this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law the negative references ive identified have become an integral part of the urban africanamerican existence this mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable this ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has there is an overwhelming part of the africanamerican community that is aware of this crippling mentality there are also many that are unaware and unfortunately more that do not even care those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily whether because of habit or misguided values this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance it should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us we must save ourselves i am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now and are thinking what right do i have to express the opinions i have thus far as well as those i have al luded too i have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content there is far too much negativity thriving within our culture there must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth whether good or bad i am aware that not all of us have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community and i have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life any similarities and generalizations i illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified additionally throughout this book i will refer to africanamericans in four different ways the first being africanamericans denoting our status as citizens in the united states secondly as black a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country third as niggas a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with nigger the term nigga has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship hence the term my nigga as well as a blanket reference when speaking to of or about other black males in a nonpersonal manner i felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences i will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place and fourth as ghetto this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the  less polished members of our community  it is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such my commentary is based on reallife situations both good and bad and how one africanamerican man was affected by them to that end i feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals i have encountered despite the negativity they have displayed i only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to in many ways has caused them to become their own worst enemyin the case of the black females negative and limited perspective toward black men the world and subconsciously themselves i submit that this mentality is perhaps singlehandedly responsible for the lack of success happiness and quality of life that is at the center of every africanamerican womans fantasy quest it is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men has been deliberately created by white america for example much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day many past issues have taken on new identities and have reemerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men the resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate america without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design there are other core issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation such as color barriers light skin versus dark skin good hair versus bad hair loyalty devotion and economic status believe it or not there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didnt sell drugs or was not thugged out a term for being rough or hoodlumlike the reasoning behind it being that the thug and drug dealer lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence these issues among others relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society sadly that confused mentality is responsible for much of the neglect the african american ghetto community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren who have locked it away in the basement and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ghetto america does not exist furthermore the lack of acknowledgement of which i speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the african american community  their plight is a wellknown reality but in many cases much of ghetto america falls under that same umbrella be advised this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into black america  rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young african americans including myself have come to perpetuate moreover that backward thinking is the main  cause of our inability to strive for a common goal an outcome that must be met and can only be met with godly faith positive strategy cooperation love loyalty self and mutual respect to read more go to

militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on oftendubious international accords this sad realization september  brutallyexposed and we all should cry for the beloved continent that

mordor from its picturesque borders withonly a few brave frodos and bilbos tagging along nothing has proved moresobering to americans than the skepticism of these blinkered europeanhobbits after september america learned that moderate arab countries are as dangerous as hostileislamic nations after september  being a saudi egyptian or kuwaitimeans nothing special to an american \\x97 at least not proof of being any morefriendly or hostile than having libyan syrian or lebanese citizenshipindeed our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad oftheir anticommunism oil and

deadly to our interests as scud missiles \\x97 and as likely to comefrom friends as enemies worstcase scenarios like iran and afghanistanoffer more longterm hope than stable regimes like the saudis governmentsthat hate us have populations that like us \\x97 and vice versa the saudi royalfamily whom  american troops protect and the mubarak autocracy whichhas snagged billions of american dollars

years ago indeed most troops who went through the ghastly inferno ofvietnam are now in or nearing retirement and thank god there is nogeneration of americans in the present military \\x97 other than a few thousandbrave veterans of the gulf mogadishu and panama \\x97 who have been insustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties because americansoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic securityis lax in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up inlower manhattan fly regularly on a jumbo jet or handle mail at thepentagon or cia than be at sea on a sub or destroyerreal concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather thanrejecting force inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroadas our women children aged and

highrisespolitics have been turned upside down in the old days cynicalconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimesrepellent realpolitik in the age of russian expansionism they were loatheto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist trojan horse whosebelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians thus they wereso often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftistsno longer the end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive sovietcommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy championsof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promiseopen economics loot their treasuries and keep out the russians insteadeven reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments inthe middle

claimnonintervention not justice as their first priority the right not theleft now is the greater proponent of global freedom liberation andidealism \\x97 with obvious domestic ramifications for any

now\\x92s your chance bronson  the serial hostage taker not the movie star  has written a health and fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary muscle power   solitary fitness  a title which bears testament to the fact that bronson  has spent  of his  prison years in solitary confinement  explains how he has turned himself into a lean mean fitness machine while living  hours a day in a space just  feet by eight feet on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost   the book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a fortune on gym memberships protein supplements or designer trainers and starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the exercise industry   i pick up a fitness mag i start to laugh and i wipe my arse with it is the opening paragraph penned by bronson it\\x92s a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal you can\\x92t help feeling he has a point   this is not the first book that bronson has written from behind bars having already published birdman opens his mind which features drawings and poems created by bronson while in prison and he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at her majesty\\x92s pleasure   jimmy boyle the scots sculptor and novelist discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to barlinnie prison\\x92s famous special unit which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of babs rooney in  once released he moved to edinburgh where he has become a respected artist his first novel hero of the underworld was published in  and his autobiography a sense of freedom was made into an awardwinning film   hugh collins was jailed for life in  for the murder of william mooney in glasgow and in his first year in barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers earning him an extra sevenyear sentence but after being transferred to the same unit that boyle attended he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art he later published autobiography of a murderer a frank account of glasgow\\x92s criminal culture in the s which received critical praise   and lord archer doesn\\x92t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail he recently signed a threebook deal with macmillan publishers worth a reported £ million and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak   so why is it that men like collins bronson and boyle who can be so destructive towards society on the outside can become so creative once stuck on the inside steve richards bronson\\x92s publisher has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound   he says prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills   it may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education if their early years have been hard it could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents   however richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that he says once they are behind bars the cold light of day hits them and they examine the very essence of who they are   they ask themselves am i a man who wants to be remembered for violence or am i a man who can contribute to society who can be remembered for something good   bronson  who was born michael gordon peterson but changed his name to that of the hollywood star of the death wish films  has so far been remembered mainly for things bad he was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in  and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison in  he was jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly two days during a jail siege   standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing lbs he is renowned for his strength he has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to   yes   pressups a day as he puts it i can hit a man  times in four seconds i can push  press ups in  seconds   but judging by our current obsession with health and exercise solitary fitness might be the book which will see bronson\\x92s face sitting on every coffee table in the land he might be the man to give us the dream body which so many socalled fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into because bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists   all this crap about highprotein drinks pills diets it\\x92s just a load of bollocks and a multimillionpound racket he writes in what can only be described as a refreshingly honest style we can all be fat lazy bastards it\\x92s our choice i\\x92m sick of hearing and reading about excuses if you stuff your face with shit you become shit that\\x92s logical to me   as motivational mantras go that might be just the kick up the er backside we all needed    solitary fitness by

       " 'free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift wholesocieties out of povertyim not a sociopoliticalhistory buff  does anybody have some clearexamples original message from rohit khare kharealumnicaltecheduto forkspamassassintaintorgsent friday september    pmsubject sed sunited statesroman empireg  a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human  race lives on less than  a day is neither just nor stable absolutely correct perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on earth today the following is a fascinating document of official government policy that bears close reading it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world   the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does  however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the  future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an  area where america must excel i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa our new musicandnews channel for  year old arabs its  in practically every market its entered nearing  listenership in amman and its even beginning to be trusted for news well past bbc and taking share from every other government broadcaster it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the longterm as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term many of you may disagree but i found the document below surprisingly centrist if you know the code you can hear clearly partisan tones re icc taiwan relations act etc but still this is as much a democratic platform as not africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared they might as you read replace united states with roman empire and it may make as much sense in the long view of history i dont know how proud to be about that but it is telling sometime i daydream that the president might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our  military installations overseas and what they do for us it would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us heck id love to see a realtime map of federal expenditures around the globe a softly glowing necklace of embassies carriers arctic research stations hotels golf courses warehouses libraries clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy of course this still doesnt leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document the bush doctrine for preemptive strikes id sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world rohit  september   full text bushs national security strategy following is the full text of president bushs new national security strategy the document entitled the national security strategy of the united states will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of the administrations policy introduction the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom  and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise in the twentyfirst century only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity people everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children  male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor these values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society  and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedomloving people across the globe and across the ages today the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence in keeping with our heritage and principles we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage we seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty by making the world safer we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better we will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the federal government today that task has changed dramatically enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger america now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal  from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing the war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration america will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror and america will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror  because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization the united states and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases together we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination the united states will not allow these efforts to succeed we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery we will cooperate with other nations to deny contain and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies and as a matter of common sense and selfdefense america will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed we cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best so we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act in the new world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action as we defend the peace we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war today the worlds great powers find ourselves on the same side  united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos the united states will build on these common interests to promote global security we are also increasingly united by common values russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth in time they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness america will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order we will strongly resist aggression from other great powers  even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity trade and cultural advancement finally the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe we will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world the events of september   taught us that weak states like afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty  so the united states will work with individual nations entire regions and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity the united states will deliver greater development assistance through the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom we will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of aids and other infectious diseases in building a balance of power that favors freedom the united states is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely so that aid is well spent for freedom to thrive accountability must be expected and required we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedomloving nations the united states is committed to lasting institutions like the united nations the world trade organization the organization of american states and nato as well as other longstanding alliances coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions in all cases international obligations are to be taken seriously they are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment freedom is the nonnegotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person  in every civilization throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedoms triumph over all these foes the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission i overview of americas international strategy our nations cause has always been larger than our nations defense we fight as we always fight for a just peace  a peace that favors liberty we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent president bush west point new york june   the united states possesses unprecedented  and unequaled  strength and influence in the world sustained by faith in the principles of liberty and the value of a free society this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities obligations and opportunity the great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom for most of the twentieth century the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality that great struggle is over the militant visions of class nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited america is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few we must defeat these threats to our nation allies and friends this is also a time of opportunity for america we will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty the us national security strategy will be based on a distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests the aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom peaceful relations with other states and respect for human dignity and this path is not americas alone it is open to all to achieve these goals the united states will  champion aspirations for human dignity  strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends  work with others to defuse regional conflicts  prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction  ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade  expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy  develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and  transform americas national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century ii champion aspirations for human dignity some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong i disagree different circumstances require different methods but not different moralities president bush west point new york june   in pursuit of our goals our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere no nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppressed aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property these demands can be met in many ways americas constitution has served us well many other nations with different histories and cultures facing different circumstances have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance history has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals but even in our worst moments the principles enshrined in the declaration of independence were there to guide us as a result america is not just a stronger but is a freer and more just society today these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty and when openings arrive we can encourage change  as we did in central and eastern europe between  and  or in belgrade in  when we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in the republic of korea and see elected leaders replace generals in latin america and africa we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today the national security strategy of the united states must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty our principles will guide our governments decisions about international cooperation the character of our foreign assistance and the allocation of resources they will guide our actions and our words in international bodies we will  speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom  use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle nonviolently for it ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take  make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and  take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it iii strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends just three days removed from these events americans do not yet have the distance of history but our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil war has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder this nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger the conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing president bush washington dc the national cathedral september   the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach the enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology the enemy is terrorism  premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents in many regions legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace such grievances deserve to be and must be addressed within a political process but no cause justifies terror the united states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them we make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes  some seen some unseen today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the taliban and alqaida but it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america south america europe africa the middle east and across asia our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and communications material support and finances this will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state we will help ensure the state has the military law enforcement political and financial tools necessary to finish the task the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism we will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them deny terrorists access to the international financial system protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks however this campaign need not be sequential to be effective the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by  direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction wmd or their precursors  defending the united states the american people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders while the united states will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of selfdefense by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and  denying further sponsorship support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism this includes  using the full influence of the united states and working closely with allies and friends to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery piracy or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose  supporting moderate and modern government especially in the muslim world to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation  diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and  using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening americas homeland security to protect against and deter attack this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the truman administration created the national security council and the department of defense centered on a new department of homeland security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the fbi our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity for example emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror but all infectious diseases and masscasualty dangers our border controls will not just stop terrorists but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic while our focus is protecting america we know that to defeat terrorism in todays globalized world we need support from our allies and friends wherever possible the united states will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations such as the united nations as well as nongovernmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people threaten its neighbors and provide a haven for terrorists in the war against global terrorism we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life freedom and fear are at war and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict in leading the campaign against terrorism we are forging new productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twentyfirst century iv work with others to defuse regional conflicts we build a world of justice or we will live in a world of coercion the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small president bush berlin germany may   concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering in an increasingly interconnected world regional crisis can strain our alliances rekindle rivalries among the major powers and create horrifying affronts to human dignity when violence erupts and states falter the united states will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which us action  direct or indirect  is warranted we have finite political economic and military resources to meet our global priorities the united states will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind  the united states should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge  the united states should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves where and when people are ready to do their part we will be willing to move decisively policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles the israelipalestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering because of americas close relationship with the state of israel and key arab states and because of that regions importance to other global priorities of the united states there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine living beside israel in peace and security like all other people palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices and counts their votes the united states will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict the united states the international donor community and the world bank stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic development increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary if palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on american support for the creation of a palestinian state israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine permanent occupation threatens israels identity and democracy so the united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable credible palestinian state as there is progress towards security israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to september   and consistent with the recommendations of the mitchell committee israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop as violence subsides freedom of movement should be restored permitting innocent palestinians to resume work and normal life the united states can play a crucial role but ultimately lasting peace can only come when israelis and palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them in south asia the united states has also emphasized the need for india and pakistan to resolve their disputes this administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and pakistan these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute with pakistan our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistans choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society the administration sees indias potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twentyfirst century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly our involvement in this regional dispute building on earlier investments in bilateral relations looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law by tolerating ethnic minorities respecting the rule of law and accepting open markets indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation it is the initiative by indonesia that allows us assistance to make a difference in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities particularly mexico brazil canada chile and colombia together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security prosperity opportunity and hope we will work with regional institutions such as the summit of the americas process the organization of american states oas and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere parts of latin america confront regional conflict especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices this conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the united states therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of drugs while  as important  we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country in colombia we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups we are working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the colombian people in africa promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease war and desperate poverty this threatens both a core value of the united states  preserving human dignity  and our strategic priority  combating global terror american interests and american principles therefore lead in the same direction we will work with others for an african continent that lives in liberty peace and growing prosperity together with our european allies we must help strengthen africas fragile states help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats africas great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement and builds coalitions of the willing this administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region  countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south africa nigeria kenya and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention  coordination with european allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and  africas capable reforming states and subregional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in subsaharan africa where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference the transition to the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent v prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons along with ballistic missile technology  when that occurs even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons they want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends  and we will oppose them with all our power president bush west point new york june   the nature of the cold war threat required the united states  with our allies and friends  to emphasize deterrence of the enemys use of force producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war our security environment has undergone profound transformation having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with russia the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the soviet union however the nature and motivations of these new adversaries their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the worlds strongest states and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us make todays security environment more complex and dangerous in the s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that while different in important ways share a number of attributes these states  brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers  display no regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party  are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes  sponsor terrorism around the globe and  reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands at the time of the gulf war we acquired irrefutable proof that iraqs designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against iran and its own people but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents in the past decade north korea has become the worlds principal purveyor of ballistic missiles and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal other rogue regimes seek nuclear biological and chemical weapons as well these states pursuit of and global trade in such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the united states and our allies and friends our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries innovation in the use of military forces modern technologies including the development of an effective missile defense system and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes  proactive counterproliferation efforts we must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed we must ensure that key capabilities  detection active and passive defenses and counterforce capabilities  are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine training and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmdarmed adversaries  strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction we will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd and when necessary interdict enabling technologies and materials we will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs the recent g agreement to commit up to  billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward  effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd use whether by terrorists or hostile states minimizing the effects of wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends the united states must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our forces abroad and to help friends and allies if they are attacked it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat given the goals of rogue states and terrorists the united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past the inability to deter a potential attacker the immediacy of todays threats and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons do not permit that option we cannot let our enemies strike first  in the cold war especially following the cuban missile crisis we faced a generally status quo riskaverse adversary deterrence was an effective defense but deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks gambling with the lives of their people and the wealth of their nations  in the cold war weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them today our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors these weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states  traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose socalled soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness the overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to action for centuries international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat  most often a visible mobilization of armies navies and air forces preparing to attack we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of todays adversaries rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means they know such attacks would fail instead they rely on acts of terrorism and potentially the use of weapons of mass destruction  weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare as was demonstrated by the losses on september   mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security the greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction  and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemys attack to forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the united states will if necessary act preemptively the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the worlds most destructive technologies the united states cannot remain idle while dangers gather we will always proceed deliberately weighing the consequences of our actions to support preemptive options we will  build better more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely accurate information on threats wherever they may emerge  coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and  continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the united states or our allies and friends the reasons for our actions will be clear the force measured and the cause just vi ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few no amount  no amount  of development aid is ever enough when nations respect their people open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively president bush monterrey mexico march   a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform and the fight against corruption and it reinforces the habits of liberty we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond americas shores all governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge we will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth including  progrowth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment innovation and entrepreneurial activity  tax policies  particularly lower marginal tax rates  that improve incentives for work and investment  rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors  strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use  sound fiscal policies to support business activity  investments in health and education that improve the wellbeing and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and  free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity the lessons of history are clear market economies not commandandcontrol economies with the heavy hand of government are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies  industrialized countries emerging markets and the developing world a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to us national security interests we want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake for the sake of the global economy and for the sake of global security european efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard as are japans efforts to end deflation and address the problems of nonperforming loans in the japanese banking system we will continue to use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners  including through the group of seven g  to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth international flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies these flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty our longterm objective should be a world in which all countries have investmentgrade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost to this end we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets we will work actively with other countries the international monetary fund imf and the private sector to implement the g action plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing so we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy exchange rate policy and financial sector policy the concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics if you can make something that others value you should be able to sell it to them if others make something that you value you should be able to buy it this is real freedom the freedom for a person  or a nation  to make a living to promote free trade the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy  seize the global initiative the new global trade negotiations we helped launch at doha in november  will have an ambitious agenda especially in agriculture manufacturing and services targeted for completion in  the united states has led the way in completing the accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade organization we will assist russias preparations to join the wto  press regional initiatives the united states and other democracies in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of the americas targeted for completion in  this year the united states will advocate marketaccess negotiations with its partners targeted on agriculture industrial goods services investment and government procurement we will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent africa starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the african growth and opportunity act and leading to free trade  move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements building on the free trade agreement with jordan enacted in  the administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and singapore our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world initially central america southern africa morocco and australia will be our principal focal points  renew the executivecongressional partnership every administrations trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with congress after a gap of  years the administration reestablished majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the trade act of  this administration will work with congress to enact new bilateral regional and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade promotion authority  promote the connection between trade and development trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights competition the rule of law investment the spread of knowledge open societies the efficient allocation of resources and regional integration  all leading to growth opportunity and confidence in developing countries the united states is implementing the africa growth and opportunity act to provide marketaccess for nearly all goods produced in the  countries of subsaharan africa we will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities beyond market access the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like hivaids tuberculosis and malaria  enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the european union canada and mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology science and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture laws against unfair trade practices are often abused but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping international industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred  help domestic industries and workers adjust there is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the american steel industry the benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices these safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american workers trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets  protect the environment and workers the united states must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity we will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into us trade negotiations creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto and use the international labor organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade  enhance energy security we will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies trading partners and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied especially in the western hemisphere africa central asia and the caspian region we will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate our overall objective is to reduce americas greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by  percent over the next  years by the year  our strategies for attaining this goal will be to  remain committed to the basic un framework convention for international cooperation  obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts  develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions  promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology as well as nuclear power  which produces no greenhouse gas emissions while also improving fuel economy for us cars and trucks  increase spending on research and new conservation technologies to a total of  billion  the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a  million increase over last years budget and  assist developing countries especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as china and india so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path vii expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy in world war ii we fought to make the world safer then worked to rebuild it as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens president bush washington dc interamerican development bank march   a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than  a day is neither just nor stable including all of the worlds poor in an expanding circle of development  and opportunity  is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of us international policy decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients these are the indicators of a failed strategy working with other nations the united states is confronting this failure we forged a new consensus at the un conference on financing for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance  and the strategies to achieve those objectives  must change this administrations goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance the united states and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the worlds poorest economies within a decade the united states government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal  provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform we propose a  percent increase in the core development assistance given by the united states while continuing our present programs including humanitarian assistance based on need alone these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom governments must fight corruption respect basic human rights embrace the rule of law invest in health care and education follow responsible economic policies and enable entrepreneurship the millennium challenge account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms  improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development banks in raising living standards the united states is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the worlds poor we have reversed the downward trend in us contributions and proposed an  percent increase in the us contributions to the international development association ida  the world banks fund for the poorest countries  and the african development fund the key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth especially in the poorest countries we will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity such as improvements in education health rule of law and private sector development every project every loan every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries  insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the worlds poor when it comes to economic development what really matters is that more children are getting a better education more people have access to health care and clean water or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families we have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results for this reason we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals thanks to us leadership the recent ida replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress for the first time donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the achievement of actual development results and part of the us contribution is linked in this way we will strive to make sure that the world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do  increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans greater use of resultsbased grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments particularly in the social sectors without saddling them with everlarger debt burdens as a result of us leadership the recent ida agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education hivaids health nutrition water sanitation and other human needs our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks we will also challenge universities nonprofits and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results  open societies to commerce and investment trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth even if government aid increases most money for development must come from trade domestic capital and foreign investment an effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy  secure public health the scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like hivaids malaria and tuberculosis growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure the united states has strongly backed the new global fund for hivaids organized by un secretary general kofi annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care the united states already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor if the global fund demonstrates its promise we will be ready to give even more  emphasize education literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development only about  percent of world bank resources are devoted to education this proportion should grow the united states will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least  percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in africa the united states can also bring information technology to these societies many of whose education systems have been devastated by aids  continue to aid agricultural development new technologies including biotechnology have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water using sound science the united states should help bring these benefits to the  million people including  million children who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition viii develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers of global power we have our best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war president bush west point new york june   america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions  as broad as practicable  of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities an appreciation of others interests and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in canada and europe europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the north atlantic treaty organization nato which has since its inception been the fulcrum of transatlantic and intereuropean security and the european union eu our partner in opening world trade the attacks of september  were also an attack on nato as nato itself recognized when it invoked its article v selfdefense clause for the first time natos core mission  collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies  remains but nato must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances nato must build a capability to field at short notice highly mobile specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened creating coalitions under natos own mandate as well as contributing to missionbased coalitions to achieve this we must  expand natos membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests  ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare  develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces  take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities  streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training integrating and experimenting with new force configurations and  maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces if nato succeeds in enacting these changes the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the cold war we will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests at the same time we welcome our european allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the eu and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato we cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come the attacks of september  energized americas asian alliances australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september  was an attack on australia itself following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the worlds finest combat forces for operation enduring freedom japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack we have deepened cooperation on counterterrorism with our alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand the war against terrorism has proven that americas alliances in asia not only underpin regional peace and stability but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges to enhance our asian alliances and friendships we will  look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests our common values and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation  work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longerterm  build on  years of usaustralian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems  as we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora  maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and  build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as asean and the asiapacific economic cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition  most importantly russia india and china in all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape with russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twentyfirst century the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries the moscow treaty on strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive longterm relations with the euroatlantic community and the united states russias top leaders have a realistic assessment of their countrys current weakness and the policies  internal and external  needed to reverse those weaknesses they understand increasingly that cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism we are facilitating russias entry into the world trade organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations we have created the natorussia council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among russia our european allies and ourselves we will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russias growing commitment to integration into the euroatlantic community at the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our relations russias uneven commitment to the basic values of freemarket democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern russias very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years  or even decades the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based on a conviction that us interests require a strong relationship with india we are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well we have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia differences remain including over the development of indias nuclear and missile programs and the pace of indias economic reforms but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership with india we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous asiapacific region we welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy chinas leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asiapacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness in time china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula likewise we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counterterrorism and similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of hivaids challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting villagelevel elections yet remains strongly committed to national oneparty rule by the communist party to make that nation truly accountable to its citizens needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can china reach its full potential our important trade relationship will benefit from chinas entry into the world trade organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers workers and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner with over  billion in annual twoway trade the power of market principles and the wtos requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens there are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the selfdefense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree the events of september   fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities with our longstanding allies in europe and asia and with leaders in russia india and china we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action in the longterm these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress ix transform americas national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people president bush washington dc joint session of congress september   the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements all of them must be transformed it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our militarys highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively our military must  assure our allies and friends  dissuade future military competition  deter threats against us interests allies and friends and  decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the worlds most strategically vital regions however the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces a military structured to deter massive cold warera armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the us commitments to allies and friends through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the longdistance deployment of us forces before the war in afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing longrange precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure us access to distant theaters and protect critical us infrastructure and assets in outer space innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting us intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention finally while maintaining nearterm readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states our allies and our friends we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy  whether a state or nonstate actor  to impose its will on the united states our allies or our friends we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military buildup in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the united states intelligence  and how we use it  is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object  the soviet bloc  the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement initiatives in this area will include  strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nations foreign intelligence capabilities  establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies  continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage  investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and  collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with allsource analysis as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend americas interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments and in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with nongovernmental organizations and international institutions officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by american readiness to play our part just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the international criminal court icc whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect us nationals from the icc we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of us personnel and officials we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war at home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing in a globalized world events beyond americas borders have a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish  our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life  are vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks as time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons this is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive  in spite of it in exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values ultimately the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions a diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that energy that is where our national security begins',\n",

and dr roy spencer of nasas marshall space flight center use data gathered by microwave sounding units msus on national oceanic and atmospheric administration tirosn satellites to get accurate direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the earth including remote deserts rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise availablethe accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since january  has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data a recent study  found a  percent agreement between the msu data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observationsonce the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed it is placed in a public computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the us and abroad it has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change and is cited in reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate changegathering the datawhile traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere each of the more than  readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than  cubic kilometers of airthe msu makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere the intensity of the microwave emissions  their brightness  varies according to temperaturechristy and spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature datasetverifying the accuracy of msu measurementsa recent comparison  of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems  microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons  found a remarkable level of agreement between the twoto verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units christy compared temperature readings recorded by radiosonde thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch siteshe found a  percent correlation over the year period of the study the overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within  degrees celsius about ° fahrenheit per decade the same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regionsthe idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement christy said if satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites that means you should be able to trust them everywhere elsethe  radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of  degrees celsius about ° fahrenheit per decade since  over those  spots on the globe the satellites also recorded a warming trend  degrees celsius about ° fahrenheit per decadeglobally however the satellite data show a cooling trend of  degrees celsius per decade since the first noaa tirosn satellites went into servicethese  radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet christy said they are not representative of the total globeradiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world usually at noon and midnight greenwich standard time as each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radiowhile there are more than  radiosonde launch sites globally the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected christy used data from  sites at which there has been longterm systematic and reliable data collection these  radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by iceland trinidad truk island and alaskain an earlier study an upper air temperature record compiled by noaa from  daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a year climate trend of ° c per decade which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time christy saidglobal coverageone advantage of the msu dataset is its global coverage microwave sounding units aboard noaa satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than  percent of the globe each satellite measures the temperature above most points on earth every  hoursthe global temperature that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method it neglects vast oceanic and continental regions including antarctica the brazilian rain forests the sahara desert and greenlandthe most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from groundbased thermometers more than  thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientistsmost of these thermometers which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground are in areas easily accessible to people in the us and other industrial countries these thermometers are most often found at airportsthe groundbased network is extensive in north america europe russia china and japan it is less comprehensive in africa south america australia and across much of southern asiatemperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world usually at noon and midnight greenwich standard timewhile balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world they are concentrated in industrial nations there are more than  radiosonde launch sites globally if they were evenly distributed around the world that would equal approximately one for every  square miles of the earths surfacewater temperatures which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures come from thermometers on piers and buoys and aboard ships of opportunity the ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines the water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage tending instead to be concentrated in heavilytravelled shipping lanes and in harborsin the past  years a new system of approximately  deep ocean buoys has been established gathering both atmospheric and water temperature datainstrument accuracy msuwith nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years a method was devised to merge all the data into a single consistent time serieseach satellite has its own bias that if not calculated and removed would introduce spurious trends the biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years and were sufficient to determine these biasesbecause the msu instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations the biases between the satellites are known to within  deg the final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base to check the final product comparisons were made over a year period with balloon measurements as stated above and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurateinstrument accuracy groundbased thermometersof great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings since most thermometers for which longterm records exist are in towns and cities the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads parking lots runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization this temperature change may be an artifact of a local asphalt effect rather than a longterm widespread climate changeinstrument accuracy ships of opportunitywhile the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature this data reflects water temperatures from about three to  feet below the surface  the level from which water is drawn into the shipsthe thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and

so all packets except syns are candidates for delay when traffic limits are exceeded whoopsyou should change that to  are always candidates for predictive orpreventive delayacks are delayed per flow in such a way that wanbound traffic reachingthe edge routers ethernet interface does not exceed wan link speed norouter queues it does not wait for the link to be at or near saturationto act  that is why unlike queueing it is predictive and not reactiveit slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts on a perflowbasis to accommodate wan link speed limit and current network utilizationrather than fill up queues at lan speeds and empty them at wan speedseventually dropping the excess once the queues fill up informing hosts toslow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixedthreshold rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic ever heardof an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic queueing packetsafter they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense does itre ipsecgre or other encapsulated trafficit obviously cannot dissect ipsecgre or other encapsulated traffic it seesthe tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the ps on thelan side vpn gateway and router are two separate devices ps between themif the router does the tunneling then the ps sees clear traffic typicallyin an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters andthe second at branch offices the ps at the branch sees traffic inside thetunnel whereas the unit at hq sees all traffic as one tunnel which allowsfull management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both endsudp and asymmetrical tcp where the ps and router only see the outgoingpacket return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a stationon the lan are handled differentlyfor asymmetrical tcp it will time the release of packets to the receivingdevice thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by thereceiving host this informs the senders tcpip stack that it should slowthe release of packets because limited bandwidth is availablefor udp it utilizes flowbased derivative random drop it selectively dropsonly one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestionwhich prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeoutsicmp packets exceeding policy limits are droppedmaybe you can do a special case for tcp and try to offload some of thequeueing on the endpoints but i really dont see the real gain in thatthe real gain is manageability and control a lan host only knows about thestate of its own connections and is oblivious to wan conditions until itstcpip stack learns when router queues are nearly full that the wan iscongested a ps will predict and inform the lan hosts tcpip stacks of thespeed limit to obey for every connection based on policies and networkconditions avoiding congestion control for asymmetrical tcp and udp maynot be as tight as for symmetrical tcp but it does workqueueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur vs ratecontrol where cops are permanently deployed throughout town communicatingwith each other and with a central control point predicting upcomingcongestion and regulating traffic ensuring a smooth flow of traffic ifthere is potential for congestion it will take a driver a hell of lotlonger to cross town with first approach than it will with the second doyou agree original message from mikael olsson mikaelolssonclavistercomto george j jahchan firewallstechinteractivenetworksnetcc firewalls list firewallsiscorgsent wednesday july    pmsubject re qosgeorge j jahchan wrote the whole purpose of the device is to proactively prevent wancongestion  it sits between client and server client insideserver outside or client outsideserver inside  it does not make any difference and proactively adjusts the tcp window size by delaying the acknowledgement to get the sending host to honor the speed limit for that individual connection calculated in realtime based on userdefined policies and currentnetwork conditionsumm dont get me wrong here but i think youve been fed a lessthanaccurate sales pitchlets ponder this for a minutethe device works by delaying acks that is packets with the ackflag set rightletting this sink in for a whileyes all packets in an established tcp connection have the ack flag setso all packets except syns are candidates for delay when traffic limitsare exceeded whoopsokay lets assume for a second that the packets arent actually delayedbut that the ack sequence numbers or tcp window size fields are rewrittendicey all youve accomplished is move the queueing delaying fromthe traffic shaper to the endpoints you still get ltol delays bigdeal if it happens on the wire or in the stack also convincing endpointsto do delays probably results in lessthanperfect shaping since stackretransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available ratherthan having the shaper itself do it the shaper knows exactly when thereis bandwidth availablebut this doesnt even begin to touch on other protocols like udp oricmp or for that matter ipsecgrewhatever tunneled trafficneither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you canmanipulateso im forced to conclude that the packetshaper either sucks in a majorway or that your explanationthe explanation that you have been given ofit is wrong sorrywhat i think happens is that the delay is msec as long as trafficlimits arent exceeded this is reasonable but when traffic exceedsthe limits things will begin to be queued now with a wellbehavedtcp stack this will mean that it will fall back to lower transmissionrates this is how tcp was designed so that part isnt all wrongand again this kind of shaping isnt rocket science that is not tosay that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumbalways queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of thequeue but well i just cant see that you can get any smarterthan queueing when limits are actually exceeded  maybe you can doa special case for tcp and try to offload some of the queueing on

would first investigate if there is a security policy in your organisation if you dont know what i mean by a security policy i would advice you to  start reading about it a search on google would be of a big help for you  if there is a security policy i would read it and investigate what is tells about how employees are able to use their workstations for performing their function in a security  policy there should be things what employees are allowed to do on the network  internet and what not  if there isnt a security policy i would advice you to implement one in your company because without one you cant punish employees by violating the policy and if there is a court case you dont have any rock solid thing to smack around with  without a policy you are just implementing solutions to prevent employees in doing things that im my opinion they arent allowed to do on their workstations anyway i dont like the idea that  employees play games use kazaa icq msn etc etc in stead of working what we pay them to do this is why a security policy is important because then you can say to employees that they violated it and that there are consequences for that deny internet access etc etc  owkee    now that this is out of the way time to proceed about the proxy thingie  a proxy dont have to be the default gateway of your network to use it it is a function in internet explorer or whatever browser you use in your network  if you ask me checkpoint firewalls are just good in using for what their real purpose is and that is firewalling a network i dont like the idea that my firewall is also cvs http thingie because i dont think a firewall is its purpose to do that proxies are a much better solutions for that and they are also developed for that purpose  depending on your network setup and the os and proxy brand of your current proxy you have several solutions which was already provided  by people on this list my favorite proxy is squid and there are probably a lot of http blacklist programs that work with squid to block websites and stuff  i still think you should first deny direct internet traffic from workstations and only allow traffic to the internet from servers that are allowed to do so you should think about proxies email servers etc etc this should also prevent people from playing games especially those quake kinda games because those use ports that arent necessary for normal  webbrowsing games running over port  and not http related are blocked by the proxy if that proxy is a true layer  application layer proxy these kinda proxies can view

three years ago  i have proxy which we only use  cache to accelerate our internet accessing  it is not a gateway  it is  too difficult to change the topology  many thing need to be changed  did you have another idea to help me someone suggest me to buy the  websence  but i dont have the budget right now  thanks a lot  michael  hiemstra brenno wrote  michael  the first thing is to build a security policy that states what people are allowed to do and what not everyone needs to accept this policy and  if they violate it you can apply rules that you state in your security policy  if i had the option for your network setup i would install a proxy server and demand every client to connect to the proxy if they want to use the  internet  the proxy will only allow  ftp and other approved services to connect to the internet and you can let them check to some database which websites are allowed and deny access to sites that arent allowed  your company firewall will only allow the proxy to connect to the internet clients are denied  this way the clients cant connect directly to the internet game servers and on the proxy you can deny clients to connect to the game servers  i hope this is an option for you  regards   brenno  original message from\\tmichael zhao smtpmzhaoeverlastingsystemscom sent\\tdinsdag  juli   to\\tfirewallslistsgnacnet subject\\tdisable some sites  hi  all  i

give it a try you will be glad you did thanks and good luck you wont need luck just keep reading dont delete this  first read about how a  year old made  see below as seen on national tv this is the media report parents of   year old  find  cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods  new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her yearold sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash fivedollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds  all neatly rubberbanded in labeled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the yearold woman there was over  dollars in that bag  thats more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the cardealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via email a type of report to email addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past  months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the email one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever yearold the email letter listed  addresses and contained instructions to send one  dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in fivedollar bills within  weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the address list i get junk email all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the email the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his videogame magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing  bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had  magazine and about  envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the email the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the  bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didnt want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the socalled chainletter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chainletter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title  section  and  or title  section  in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume  sections  and  which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every fivedollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number xyxthis simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service a report on howto for a fivedollar fee this is the end of the media

analysis yet dont know what to make of it yet but  heres the raw  bits for all to peruse and check out whats really going on best  rohit    datapower delivers xml acceleration device by\\xa0scott tyler shafer august    am pt  datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed  specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that  process xml data in software datapowers device processes  the data in  hardware  a technology achievement that provides greater  performance  according to company officials  the new device dubbed datapower xa xml accelerator is the  first in a  family of products expected from the cambridge massbased  startup the  datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology  called xg that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml  data  according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xa accelerator was  conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future  proliferation of web services and as a means to share data  between two  businesses  our vision is to build out an xmlaware infrastructure kelly said  the xa is the first of a family  kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the  file size up  to  times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on  application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best  alternative  in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount  importance in the world of xml  todays firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly  said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall  firewalls are blind to xml today  future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on  security especially as web services proliferate kelly said  according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml  processing are homegrown and done in software  an approach  the company  itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with  regards to speed  and security after trying the software path the company turned to  creating a solution that would process xml in hardware  our xg execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly  adding that to his knowledge no other companys solution does kelly  said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with  technologies that claim to do xml processing  claims that  he believes  will be mostly false other contentaware switches such as ssl secure socket layer  accelerators and load balancers look at the first  bytes  of a packet  while the xa provides deeper packet inspection looking at   bytes  and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained  the uhigh network device has been tested against a large  collection of  xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the  markup language  as they pass through the device  the xa can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load  balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and  will identify  and process those packets that are xml kelly said  in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an  application  coprocessor this deployment method gives administrators  more granular  control over what data is inspected and the application server itself  controls the device  datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging  market startup  sarvega based in burr ridge ill introduced the sarvega  xpe switch in  may and earlier this month tarari an intel spinoff  launched with a  focus on content processing and acceleration the datapower device is now available priced

xmlinsilicon   no analysis yet dont know what to make of it yet but  heres the raw  bits for all to peruse and check out whats really going on best  rohit    datapower delivers xml acceleration device by\\xa0scott tyler shafer august    am pt  datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed  specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that  process xml data in software datapowers device processes  the data in  hardware  a technology achievement that provides greater  performance  according to company officials  the new device dubbed datapower xa xml accelerator is the  first in a  family of products expected from the cambridge massbased  startup the  datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology  called xg that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml  data  according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xa accelerator was  conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future  proliferation of web services and as a means to share data  between two  businesses  our vision is to build out an xmlaware infrastructure kelly said  the xa is the first of a family  kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the  file size up  to  times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on  application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best  alternative  in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount  importance in the world of xml  todays firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly  said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall  firewalls are blind to xml today  future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on  security especially as web services proliferate kelly said  according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml  processing are homegrown and done in software  an approach  the company  itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with  regards to speed  and security after trying the software path the company turned to  creating a solution that would process xml in hardware  our xg execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly  adding that to his knowledge no other companys solution does kelly  said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with  technologies that claim to do xml processing  claims that  he believes  will be mostly false other contentaware switches such as ssl secure socket layer  accelerators and load balancers look at the first  bytes  of a packet  while the xa provides deeper packet inspection looking at   bytes  and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained  the uhigh network device has been tested against a large  collection of  xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the  markup language  as they pass through the device  the xa can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load  balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and  will identify  and process those packets that are xml kelly said  in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an  application  coprocessor this deployment method gives administrators  more granular  control over what data is inspected and the application server itself  controls the device  datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging  market startup  sarvega based in burr ridge ill introduced the sarvega  xpe switch in  may and earlier this month tarari an intel spinoff  launched with a  focus on content processing and acceleration the datapower device is now

long before industry  interest in xml  grew kuznetsov assembled a team of worldclass mit engineers and  designed the industrys first solutions to address the unique  requirements for processing xml the first such solution was  a software  interpreter called dgxt this softwarebased approach to xml  processing  is still licensed by many companies for use in their own  products today  leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from  developing softwarebased accelerators kuznetsovs team  raised the bar  and designed a system for processing xml in purposebuilt  hardware in

several spam clues are duplicated with different variationshotel hotels hotels subjecthotel rates rates wrt hating html possibilities include   it really had to do with something other than mimehtml   these are pure html not multipartalternative with a textplain part    so that the tags arent getting stripped  the pickled classifier    despises all hints of html due to its clpy heritage   these are multipartalternative with a textplain part but the    latter doesnt contain the same text as the texthtml part for    example as anthony reported perhaps the textplain part just    says something like this is an hmtl message  if its  it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize meaning even if it is pure html strip the tags anyway  in fact id like to do that and default it to true

may beits about design patterns architecture high level stuffrobert harley wroteif your problem just requires application of a design pattern to solvethen its trivial anyway irrespective of

arent mosthigh level problems solved with high level solutions like design patternsor do you solve high level problems by writing optimal cc code  forexample do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworksthere are lots of them on this list are working on writing an operatingsystem with assembly that provides for a collaborative environmenti am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about lowlevel problems that have been solved  million times over and overand over againrobert harley wroteyou appear to be gratuitously asserting that c programmers waste timeon irrelevant lowlevel problems and java programmers dont  dependsentirely on the programmer not the languagei can see how you could infer this however what i believe to really be thecase is that java is one of the best languages for writing largeapplications with many components that involves the collaboration of morethan three programmers  in those cases its always very hard to get theprogrammers to agree on apis memory management techniques etc  withjava the jcp takes care of the discussions so that you dont sit around ina long meeting trying to decide what api to use to hook up to a databasejdbc or a messaging bus jms  java is not just a programming language its also a platformrobert harley wrotebuzzwordyikes  have you written db code with cc for different databases just anexample  tried porting a persistence layer from windows to unix  say youhave informix running on solaris and you want to port to windows with ms sqlbad ideabut for the sake of the example would you rather deal withjdbc port or cc port that uses informix drivers and now you have to useodbca monolithic set of apis or a crap load of different apis slicingand dicing the same problems  different

government that has beeninternationally criticized and documented time and again for fraudabuse of human rights outright theft and is in default on almost everyfinancial obligation it has ever made what purpose do you propose toserve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting forthe very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreigninvaders bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by theirown corrupt governmentnamely the dom and sister nation the kingdom of enenkio themarshallese name for wake islandcomment nothing could be further from the truth we cannot speak fordom but as for the kingdom we dont even know what being a sisternation means and for you to make this categorically false statement isnot only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio it is adeceptive intrusion upon the sovereign his majesty king remios thesovereign of enenkio and eneenkio atoll and an inexplicable andirresponsible abuse of journalism doesnt anybody check sourcesanymorecorrection the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state andthe same could be said for domclaiming to represent the midpacific nation amid an allegedinvestment scam according to an article in agence france pressecomment the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the peopleof enenkio who are forced to live in exile from eneenkio atoll landsand seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture forperhaps  years furthermore an article in agence francepressehas no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islandsgovernment my preceding comments apply the kingdom of enenkio is notnow and never has been engaged in an investment scam we havetried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sourcesfor programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio but alsowill positively impact people around the globe in fact we arecurrently working with a former nasa astronaut one tool scammers havein their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimateentities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant many journalistsuse the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism doesntanybody check sources anymorethe marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countriesagainst acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives ofeither nationcomment the kingdom of enenkio has made no fraudulent claims ofwhich i am aware and in my post i am responsible for all publishedinformation i would personally caution any countries againstacknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives ofnations companies or publications if i had credible proof to thateffect however my preceding comments apply as to credibility of anyrmi ministry source furthermore the rmi has repeatedly attacked thecredibility of his majesty king hermios who happens to be the ancestralsovereign owner under marshallese custom of over  of the land in themarshall islands including recent attempts to sequester him against hiswill we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what willhappen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration oflands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs andthey no longer have their hands on the till to perpetrate theirjaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalisma honolulubased attorney created the kingdom of enenkio in theearly scomment mr moore is not an attorney though he was living in honoluluin the early scorrection the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of theowner of eneenkio atoll aka enenkio halcyon disclerta wake and other names iroijlaplap murjel hermios who then was paramountchief of the northern ratak atolls he passed away in december  andwas fully recognized by the rmi government he declared the sovereignstate of enenkio in  whereupon the people chose him as their kingover eneenkio atoll ratified the constitution and establishedgovernment as a limited constitutional monarchyit was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islandsparamount chief mursel sic hermios which granted the attorney broadpowers to act on his behalfcorrection the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was madepossible by murjels appointment of mr robert moore the adoptedbrother of hermios alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen to thepost of minister plenipotentiary the document of appointment was also aspecial power of attorney which granted mr moore very specificinstructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states fromeneenkio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios and thepeoples behalfthe marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid andordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputedcomment since when is a special power of attorney an agreement themarshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the specialpower of attorney except as has been publicized by the kingdom ofenenkio and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneenkio atollwhich lies over  miles north of lawful rmi boundaries the rmi has nopolitical or territorial jurisdiction

their form ofgovernmentthe kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the th dayof september  but it did not convey a lease of land it declared astate of peace and established diplomatic recognition between ourgovernments however a prior agreement signed in may  which hadnothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio transferred mr robertmoores rights to develop taongi from mr moore to dom it did notconvey a lease at that time and no such document is in existencethis was made possible because mr moore is the alab one class oflandowner of taongi and had a legal power of attorney

called wake island is comprised of threesmall islands wake wilkes and peale named by western explorers forwestern persons what of the native discoverers the crux of the issueis that despite the passage of ownership via a complex matriarchal landtenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginalchiefs of the northern ratak atolls of marshall islands the unitedstates seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in and again in historical records reveal that the multiplelandings by united states warships en route to the philippines on warmissions and subsequent congressional action were the sole basis ofthe us claim the motivation was said to be for the establishment of acable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in theeast such a station was never established at wake island it wasdestined to become a military installationhowever formal protests of the seizure was sent to the us presidentby the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure ofcorrespondence followed but since the us abandoned the area withoutestablishing a colony or cable station and germany was defeated in thefirst world war the objections fell into oblivion it is understoodfrom written accounts of oral marshallese culture and traditions thatjurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued the us did notestablish a settlement there until under a lease in  the caapredecessor of the faa allowed pan american airways to build a basefor its fleet of transpacific seaplanes clearly the socalledannexation by the us is grossly flawed the occupation patentlyillegal and its ownership is held therefore to be wholly invalidwhen the us congress apologized for the overthrow of the hawaiianmonarchy in  and the us navy

illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior yearand the return of the hawaiian island kahoolawe also of religioussignificance has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkiocitizensparting shotwhat truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government ingeneral the us federal government more precisely which somehowbehaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys theright to rearrange lands cultures and economics with out the slightestinclination to counsel with those people most concerned such anapproach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant cornerof the globe but considering its present source it is downrightalarming it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominenttrail left over the course of more than two years letters reportsforms published articles press releases legal notices documents andvirtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios haveescaped official response from officers of the us federal governmentour nottoodistant past is replete with examples of the insatiablethirst of western civilized nations for doctrines faithful to the cryof manifest destiny which clearly marked american foreign policy of acentury ago if this current trend signifies a resurgence it can onlybe considered a giant leap backward considering the flimsy record ofamerican attempts at fixing up the world the title of ownership andinheritance of eneenkio atoll predates formation of the united statesby two centuries or more it is time the significance of native culturesand recognition of their right to selfdetermination is elevated frommatters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement indetermining the future course of human endeavor people have a right toknow the media a responsibility to show themin conclusion i reiterate that our focus from my point of view isone not so much of opposition to the ominous might of us politicalphilosophy and

    "We decided to use Minibatch KMeans due to the large size of the dataset. Functionally it shouldn't have a much different result than regular KMeans, but it will save us hours when running the process. An iterator was used to test different sizes for number of clusters and batch size, but ultimately the batch size didn't change the results much, so it was set at 500 to reduce computation time. We attempted to use the Elbow Method to choose our optimal cluster size, but with this data, the chart was inconclusive. At least this model can serve to reduced the dimensionality of the original text data. Since there are so many clusters, we will not do any visualiztion for this particular model - instead we will use the results in our Naive Bayes model and compare that to a vanilla model. "

    "The above chart shows a comparison of the word cound from each of the 50 clusters, color coded by whether the words were from a spam or ham email. The chart is a little unweildly, but you can see that the clusters tend to be well distinguished from each other in this regard - clusters with word counts from ham emails tend to have little to no word counts from spam emails and vice versa. Additionally the clusters may have been formed in part by email length - grouping the more verbose emails into a cluster together. "

    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "The chart above displays each of the 50 clusters in its own plot, with two columns for ham vs spam, with character count on the y-axis. Unfortunately the visual as a whole suffers from extreme outliers on two of the plots, rendering the distribution of the other plots difficult to see, but this can still be a helpful visual nonetheless. Similar to the first graph, we can see that where there are occurances of spam, there is little ham in a cluster and vice versa. Although it's difficult to see, upon careful inspection, the clusters are tight around a specific character count per plot, with the exception of the two plots with extreme outliers. Those two clusters appear to be almost a catch-all for outliers, and in a more extensive exploration they would warrent closer inspection to determine why they were so difficult to place. Perhaps the main feature that cluster is formed on has no correlation with word count at all. Without taking a look at the text files in that cluster or doing some form of MLP, we cannot know. That is one of the main drawbacks to this form of unsupervised clustering. "

    "KMeans clustering is great for determining associations between groups of data that are too complex for humans to see. Although the data available to us was less clustered than desirable for this method, it's clear to see how useful this method can be to  understand unstructured data and support further analysis. "

    "Unfortunately as you can see, our more complex model that utilized KMeans with 1000 clusters failed to provide a useful model since it ignored spam emails and just allowed all emails to pass through as ham. This resulted in 83% accuracy but 0 precision and recall. Our basic naive bayes model with no preprocessing had a fairly accurate correct prediction rate of 96%, with precision and recall at a solid 92% and 85% respectively. "

    "- After all of your technical analysis and modeling; what are you proposing to your audience and why?   \n",
    "    - We propose to use a naive bayes classification model for the quickest implementation for a spam filter. However, for deeper insight into spam types and perhaps an even more accurate filter, it's worth considering building off the insights provided by KMeans clustering and digging deeper into some of the clusters.   \n",
    "       \n",
    "- How should they view your results and what should they consider when moving forward?\n",
    "    - They should consider that 96% accuracy is pretty good, but that means they will still recieve on average 2-3 spam emails into their inbox per 100 emails, and about 1 important message per 100 emails could be misclassified as spam. The management team should weigh the cost of devoting additional resources to improving the accuracy versus the *potential* benefit of having no important emails going to spam and only 1-2 spam emails per 100. \n",
    "- Are there other approaches you'd recommend exploring?\n",
    "   - Since the accuracy of the filter is so high already, there may be diminishing returns to explore this further. The only thing that may make it even more accurate is taking some time to further clean the text data - our analysis used the entire email, including metadata. Being able to isolate only the actual conversation would possibly help the analysis.   \n",
    "- This is where you \"bring it all home\" in language they understand.\n",
    "    - Through our analysis we generated valuable insight into key differences between spam emails and real emails, and tested several different types of models. In the end, the best one was fairly simple and it would be hard to improve upon short of natural language processing. "
