# Email Spam Classifier
 - The objective of this project is to build an email spam classifier using Naive Bayes and clustering methods. 
 - Since there is no inherent structured dataset we will rely on raw email messages from 5 separate folders that are pre-classified as either spam or ham (not spam).  
 - From an educational standpoint, this type of work/ exercise is important because often in data science we will experience unstructured data that needs to be structured, mined for meaning and ultimately in this case provide a benefit to end users by classifying emails as spam or not spam. 
 - From a business standpoint, it's important to gain insight on the types of spam the company might recieve and what may differentiate that from real emails. Spam filters are important because they allow employees to not loose their important emails in a sea of spam in their inbox, or conversely loose their important emails to the spam folder.
